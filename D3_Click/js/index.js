    "(Extended cheers, applause.)\nMITT ROMNEY: Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Mr. Chairman 鈥� Mr. Chairman and delegates 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� Mr. Chairman and delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you've placed in me. It's a great honor. It's an even greater responsibility. And tonight I'm asking you to join me to walk together to a better future.\nAnd by my side, I've chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. (Cheers, applause.) He represents the best of America, a man who will always make us very proud 鈥� my friend and America's next vice president, Paul Ryan. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn the days ahead, you're going to get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan 鈥� a strong and caring leader who's down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands, and I love the way he lights up around his kids, and how he's not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom.\n(Cheers, applause.) But Paul, I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours. (Laughter, applause.)\nFour years ago I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That choice was not the choice of our party, but Americans always come together after elections. We're a good and generous people, and we're united by so much more than what divides us. When that election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have, optimistic and positive and confident in the future.\nThat very optimism is uniquely American. It's what brought us to America. We're a nation of immigrants. We're the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in the place called America could be better. They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world, but for the richness of this life, freedom, freedom of religion 鈥� (applause) 鈥� freedom to speak their mind 鈥� (applause) 鈥� freedom to build a life and yes, freedom to build a business with their own hands. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis is the essence of the American experience. We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future.\nWhen every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just 90 miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America, they could build a better life, that in America, their children would be blessed more than they.\nBut today, four years from the excitement of that last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future. It's not what we were promised. Every family in America wanted this to be a time when they could get a little ahead, put aside a little more for college, do more for the elderly mom that's now living alone or give a little more to their church or their charity. Every small business wanted these to be their best years ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that Little League team. And every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future.\nThis is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits. This was the hope and change America voted for. It's not just what we wanted. It's not just what we expected. It's what Americans deserve. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA!\nMITT ROMNEY: You deserved it because during these years you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you could out 鈥� cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid 22.50 (dollars) an hour with benefits, you took two jobs at 9 bucks an hour. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: You deserve it because your family depended on you, and you did it because you're an American, and you don't quit. You did it because it was what you had to do. But driving home late from that second job or standing there watching the gas pump hit $50 and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house, you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just wasn't right.\nBut what could you do except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic, hug your kids a little longer, maybe spend a little more time praying that tomorrow would be a better day?\nI wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. (Cheers, applause.) But his promises gave way to disappointment and division.\nThis isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. And with your help, we will do something. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow is the moment when we can stand up and say, I'm an American, I make my destiny, we deserve better, my children deserve better, my family deserves better, my country deserves better. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo here we stand. Americans have a choice, a decision. To make that choice, you need to know more about me and where I'd lead our country.\nI was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when Americans were returning from war and eager to work. To be an American was to assume that all things were possible. When President Kennedy challenged Americans to go to the moon, the question wasn't whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there. (Cheers, applause.) The soles of Neil Armstrong's boots on the moon made permanent impressions on our souls. Ann and I watched those steps together on her parents' sofa. Like all Americans, we went to bed that night knowing we lived in the greatest country in the history of the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\nMITT ROMNEY: God bless Neil Armstrong. (Cheers, applause.)\nTonight that American flag is still there on the moon, and I don't doubt for a second that Neil Armstrong's spirit is still with us, that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy dad had been born in Mexico, and his family had to leave during the Mexican Revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the U.S. government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college, and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter.\nHe had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him and move to Detroit. He led a great 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� he led a great automobile company and became governor of the great state of Michigan. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe were 鈥� we were Mormons, and growing up in Michigan, that might have seemed unusual or out of place, but I really don't remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.\nMy mom and dad gave their kids the 鈥� the greatest gift of all 鈥� the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be and much less about what we would do. Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. (Cheers, applause.) You know, if every children could drift asleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family, and God's love, this world would be a far more gentle and better place.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMy mom and dad were married for 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died. She went looking for him because that morning there was no rose.\nMy mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped my by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still see her saying, in her beautiful voice, why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation? (Cheers, applause.)\nDon't you wish she could have been here at this convention 鈥� (cheers) 鈥� and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin, Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Susana Martinez, Senator Kelly Ayotte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice? (Cheers, applause.) As governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman lieutenant governor, a woman chief of staff. Half of my Cabinet and senior officials were women. And in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies.\nI grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself.\nThose weren't the easiest of days, many long hours and weekends working, five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night. (Laughter.) But if you asked Ann and I what we'd give to break up just one more fight between the boys or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room 鈥� well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that.\nThose days were the 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� these were tough days, on Ann particularly. She was heroic through it all. Five boys, with our families a long way away. I had to travel a lot for my job then, and I'd call and try to offer support. But every mom knows that doesn't help get the homework done or get the kids out the door to school. And I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine, and I knew without question that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd as America saw Tuesday night, Ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to do. (Cheers, applause.)\nLike a lot of families in a new place with no family, we 鈥� we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community, it was welcoming. And as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved into town or just joined our church.\nWe had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregations from all walks of life, and many who were new to America. We prayed together. Our kids played together. And we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways.\nThat's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support in good times and bad. It's both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families and our faiths. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat's the bedrock of what makes America America. In our best days we can feel the vibrancy of America's communities, large and small. It's when we see that new business opening up downtown. It's when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on the block doing the same thing. It's when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job they 鈥� offer they should take, and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like best is not too far from home. It's that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kids' soccer team or help out on school trips.\nBut for too many Americans, those kind of good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America?\nMany of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and change had a powerful appeal.\nBut tonight I'd ask a simple question.\nIf you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? (Applause.) You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nThe president hasn't disappointed you because he wanted to. The president has disappointed America because he hasn't led America in the right direction. He took office with 鈥� without the basic qualification that most Americans have, and one that was essential to the task at hand: He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs, to him, are about government. (Cheers, applause.)\nI learned the real lessons about how America works from experience. When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies; we should bet on ourselves and our 鈥� on our advice. So we started a new business called Bain Capital.\nThe only problem was, while 鈥� while we believed in ourselves, not many other people did. (Laughter.) We were young and had never done this before, and we almost didn't get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake.\nBy the way, I'd thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I didn't. (Laughter.) I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I didn't want to go to hell, too.\n(Laughter, applause.) Shows what I know. Another of my partners got the Episcopal Church Pension Fund to invest 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� and today there are a lot of happy retired priests who should thank him. (Laughter, applause.)\nThat business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you 鈥� you know and you've heard from tonight: an office company called Staples, where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign's been shopping 鈥� (laughter, applause) 鈥� the Sports Authority, which of course became a favorite of my boys; we helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised; and at a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and built one in a cornfield in Indiana, that today 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States.\nThese 鈥� (applause) 鈥� these are American success stories. (Applause.) And yet the centerpiece of the president's entire re- election campaign is attacking success. Is it any wonder that someone who attacks success has led the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression? (Cheers, applause.) In America, we celebrate success; we don't apologize for success. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow 鈥� now, we weren't always successful at Bain, but no one ever is in the real world of business. That's what this president doesn't seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It's about dreams. Usually, it doesn't work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple, and then he came back and changed the world.\nIt's the genius of the American free enterprise system to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the American people with a system that's dedicated to creating tomorrow's prosperity, not trying to redistribute today's. (Extended cheers, applause.)\nThat's why 鈥� that's why every president since the Great Depression who came before the American people asking for a second term could look back at the last four years and say with satisfaction: You're better off than you were four years ago. Except Jimmy Carter. (Laughter.) And except this president. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that the next four years he'll get it right. But this president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica's been patient. Americans have supported this president in good faith. But today the time has come to turn the page. Today the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us, to put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations, to forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be. Now is a time to restore the promise of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nMany Americans have given up on this president, but they haven't ever thought about giving up, not on themselves, not on each other and not on America. What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound. Doesn't take a special government commission to tell us what America needs. What America needs is jobs, lots of jobs. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher. Food prices are higher. Utility bills are higher. And gasoline prices, they've doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. Nearly 1-out-of-6 Americans is living in poverty. Look around you. These aren't strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans. His policies have not helped create jobs. They've depressed them.\nAnd this I can tell you about where President Obama would take America.\nHis plan to raise taxes on small business won't add jobs: It would eliminate them. (Cheers, applause.) His assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China. (Mixed boos, cheers, applause.) His trillion-dollar cuts to our military will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs and also put our security at greater risk. (Boos.) His $716 billion cut to Medicare to finance \"Obamacare\" will both hurt today's seniors and oppress innovation and jobs in medicine. (Boos.) And his trillion-dollar deficits, they slow our economy, restrain employment and cause wages to stall.\nTo the majority of Americans who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: If Barack Obama is re-elected, you'll be right. (Applause.)\nI'm running for president to help create a better future 鈥� a future where everyone who wants a job can find a job 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� where no senior feels for the 鈥� fears for the security of their retirement, an America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon.\nAnd unlike the president, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. (Cheers, applause.) Paul Ryan and I have five steps. First, by 2020, North America will be energy-independent by taking full advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear and our renewables. (Cheers, applause.)\nSecond, we'll give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice and every child should have a chance. (Cheers, applause.)\nThird, we'll make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd fifth, we will champion small businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. (Cheers, applause.) And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of health care by repealing and replacing \"Obamacare.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nToday women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do.\nAnd let me make this very clear: unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs president, I'll protect the sanctity of life. I'll honor the institution of marriage. (Cheers, applause.) And I will guarantee America's first liberty, the freedom of religion. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family. (Cheers, applause.)\nI will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began his presidency with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: Every American 鈥擻nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt!\nMITT ROMNEY: Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order and Seal Team 6 took out Osama bin Laden. (Cheers, applause.)\nOn another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat. In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.\nPresident Obama has thrown allies like Israel under the bus 鈥� (boos) 鈥� even has he as relaxed sanctions on Castro's Cuba. He abandoned our friends in Poland by walking away from our missile defense commitments. (Boos.) But he's eager to give Russia's president, Putin, the flexibility he desires after the election. (Boos.) Under my administration, our friends will see more loyalty, and Mr. Putin will see a little less flexibility and more backbone. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe will honor America's democratic ideals, because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan, and under my presidency, we will return to it once again. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou might have asked yourself if these last years are really the America we want 鈥擻nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: 鈥� the America that was won for us by \"the greatest generation.\"\nDoes the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from China?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for 23 million people and for half the kids graduating from college?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: Are those schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: And does America that we want succumb to resentment and division among Americans?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nMITT ROMNEY: The America we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for America. There's no mention of their race, their party affiliation or what they did for a living. (Cheers, applause.) They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose.\nThey pledged allegiance to the United States of America. That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past.\nThat America, that united America, will preserve a military that's so strong no nation would ever dare to test it. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat America 鈥� that America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our creator and codified in our Constitution. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly and will give a helping hand to those in need.\nThat America is the best within each of us. That America we want for our children. If I'm elected president of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it. Our nation depends on it. The peace and freedom of the world require it, and with your help, we will deliver it. (Cheers, applause.) Let us begin that future for America tonight. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you so very much. May God bless you, may God bless the American people and may God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nMARCO RUBIO: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think I just drank Clint Eastwood's water. Thank you. (Laughter.) Boy, thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me here today, and thank you so much for doing this convention here in Florida.\nYou know, before I begin this 鈥� thank you. Before I begin, this is such an important night for our country. I want to take just 鈥� with your permission, just a few seconds to talk about another country, a country located just a few hundred miles away from this city, the country of my parents' birth. There is no freedom or liberty in Cuba. And tonight, I ask for your prayers that soon freedom and liberty will be theirs as well. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt 鈥� you know, this is a big honor for me. Just not so long ago I was just a deep underdog candidate. The only people that thought I could win all lived in my house. (Laughter.) Four of them were under the age of 10. (Laughter.) But this is incredible. When I was asked to introduce Governor Romney 鈥� who we'll hear from in just a moment. I promise you, he's backstage, ready to go. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd 鈥� so I called a few people and asked them, what should I say? And they had a lot of different opinions, but the one thing they all said is, don't mess it up. (Laughter.)\nSo I thought the best way to introduce Mitt Romney tonight, the next president of the United States 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� is to talk 鈥� is to talk about what this election is about. And I'm so honored to be able to do it here in Florida at the Republican National Convention in front of all you patriots. (Cheers, applause.)\nI watched my first convention in 1980 with my grandfather. My grandfather was born to a farming family in rural Cuba. Childhood polio left him permanently disabled. Because he couldn't work the farm, his family sent him to school. He was the only one in his family that knew how to read. He was a huge influence on me growing up. As a boy, I used to sit on the porch of our house and listen to his stories about history and politics and baseball as he would puff on one of his three daily Padron cigars.\nNow, I don't remember 鈥� it's been three decades since we last sat on that porch, and I don't remember all the things he talked to me about. But the one thing I remember is the one thing he wanted me never to forget, that the dreams he had when he was young became impossible to achieve. But there was no limit how far I could go, because I was an American. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, for those of us 鈥� here's why I say that. Here's why I say that, because for those of us who were born and raised in this country, sometimes it becomes easy to forget how special America is. But my grandfather understood how different America was from the rest of the world because he knew life outside America.\nTonight you will hear from another man who understands what makes America exceptional.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney knows America's prosperity didn't happen because our government simply spent more money. It happened because our people used their own money to open a business. And when they succeed, they hire more people who invest or spend their money in the economy, helping others start a business or create jobs.\nNow tonight you have heard for a long time now about Mitt Romney's success in business. It's well-known. But we've also learned that he's so much more than that. Mitt Romney is a devoted husband, a father, a grandfather, a generous member of his community and church, a role model for younger Americans like myself. Everywhere he's been, he's volunteered his time and talent to make things better for those around him. And we are blessed that a man like this will soon be the president of these United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, let me be clear so no one misunderstands. Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person, OK? By all accounts, he, too, is a good husband and a good father and, thanks to lots of practice, a good golfer. (Laughter.) Our problem is not that he's a bad person. Our program is that he's a bad president. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou think he's watching tonight? (Laughter.) Because his new slogan for his campaign is the word \"forward.\" Forward?\nA government that spends $1 trillion more than it takes in? An $800 billion stimulus that created more debt than jobs? A government intervention into health care paid for with higher taxes and cuts to Medicare, scores of new rules and regulations 鈥� these ideas don't move us forward. These ideas move us backwards. (Cheers, applause.)\nThese are tired and old big-government ideas that have failed every time and everywhere they've been tried. These are ideas that people come to America to get away from. (Cheers, applause.) These are ideas that threaten to make a more 鈥� America more like the rest of the world instead of helping the rest of the world become more like America. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs for his old slogan, under Barack Obama, the only change is that hope is hard to find. (Laughter.)\nNow, sadly, millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us, by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. He tells Americans that they're worse off because others are better off, that rich people got rich by making other people poor. Hope and change has become divide and conquer. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut in the end, this election 鈥� it doesn't matter how you feel about President Obama because this election is about your future, not about his. And 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� and this election is not simply a choice between a Democrat and a Republican.\nIt's a choice about what kind of country we want America to be. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd as we prepare to make this choice, we should remember what made us special. You see, for most of human history, almost everybody was poor. Power and wealth only belonged to a few. Your rights were whatever your rulers allowed you to have. Your future was determined by your past. If you parents were poor, so would you be. If you were born without opportunities, so were your children.\nBut America was founded on the principle that every person has God-given rights 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� founded on the belief that power belongs to the people, that government exists to protect our rights and serve our interests and that no one should be trapped in the circumstances of their birth. We should be free to go as far as our talent and our work can take us. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd we're special 鈥� we're special because we're united 鈥� we're united not as a common race or a common ethnicity, we're bound together by common values, that family's the most important institution in society 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� and that Almighty God is the source of all we have. (Cheers, extended applause.)\nWe're special 鈥� we're special because we've never made the mistake of believing that we are so smart that we can rely solely on our leaders or on our government 鈥� our national motto, \"In God we trust,\" reminding us that faith in our creator is the most important American value of them all.\n(Cheers, applause.) And we're special 鈥� we're special because we've always understood the scriptural admonition that for everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required. (Applause.)\nWell, my fellow Americans, we are a uniquely blessed people. And we have honored those blessings with the enduring example of an exceptional America. (Applause.)\nI know for many of you watching at home tonight, the last few years have tested your faith in the promise of America. Maybe you're at an age when you thought you would be entering retirement, but now because your savings and investments are wiped out, your future is uncertain. Maybe after years of hard work, this was the time you expected to be your prime earning years, but instead you've been laid off, and your house is worth less than your mortgage. Maybe you did everything you were told you needed to do to get ahead, you studied hard and finished school, but now you owe thousands of dollars in student loans, you can't find a job in your field and you've had to move back in with your parents. You want to believe that we're still that special place where anything is possible, but you just don't seem 鈥� things just don't seem to be getting any better. And you wonder if things will ever be the same again.\nYes, we live in a troubled time, but the story of those who came before us reminds us that America has always been about new beginnings, and Mitt Romney is running for president because he knows that if we are willing to do for our children what our parents did for us, life in America can be better than it has ever been.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMy mother was one of seven girls whose parents often went to bed hungry so their children wouldn't. My father lost his mother when he was 9. He had to leave school and go to work, and he would work for the next 70 years of his life. They immigrated to America with little more than the hope of a better life. My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a hotel maid, a stock clerk at Kmart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful, because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.\nMany nights growing up, I would hear my father's keys jingling at the door as he came home after another 16-hour day. Many mornings I woke up just as my mother got home from the overnight shift at Kmart. When you're young and you're in a hurry, the meaning of moments like this escape you. But now as my children get older, I understand it better.\nMy dad used to tell us, en ese pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� in this country 鈥� in this country, you're going to be able to accomplish all the things we never could. A few years ago during a speech, I noticed a bartender behind a portable bar in the back of the ballroom. And I remembered my father, who worked for many years as a banquet bartender. He was grateful for the work he had. But that's not the life he wanted for us.\nYou see, he stood behind a bar and 鈥� in the back of the room all those years so one day I could stand behind a podium in the front of a room. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat journey, that journey from behind that bar to behind this podium goes to the essence of the American miracle, that we're exceptional not because we have more rich people here; we're special because dreams that are impossible anywhere else, they come true here.\nBut 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� but that's not just my story. That's your story. That's our story. That's the story of your mothers who struggled to give you what they never had. That's the story of your fathers who worked two jobs so that the doors that had been closed for them would be open for you. That's the story of that teacher or that coach that taught you the lessons that made you who you are today.\nAnd it's the story of a man who was born into an uncertain future in a foreign country. His family came to America to escape revolution. They struggled through poverty and the Great Depression. And yet he rose to be an admired businessman and public servant. And in November his son Mitt Romney will be elected president of these United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn America 鈥擻nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!\nMARCO RUBIO: In America, we are all just a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. America is the story of everyday people who did extraordinary things, a story woven deep into the fabric of our society. Their stories may never be famous, but in the lives they live, you will find the essence of America's greatness. And to make sure that America is still a place where tomorrow is always better than yesterday, that is what our politics should be about, and that is what we are deciding this election. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe decide, do we want our children to inherit our hopes and dreams, or do we want them to inherit our problems? Because Mitt Romney believes that if we succeed in changing the direction of our country, our children and grandchildren will be the most prosperous generation ever, and their achievements will astonish the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe story of our time will be written by Americans who haven't yet even been born. Let us make sure they write that we did our part, that in the early years of this new century, we lived in an uncertain time, but we did not allow fear to cause us to abandon what made us special. We chose more government instead of more freedom (sic). We chose the principles of our founding to solve the challenges of our time.\nWe chose a special man to lead us in a special time. We chose Mitt Romney to lead our nation. And because we did, the American miracle lives on for another generation to inherit. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy fellow Republicans, my fellow Americans, I am proud to introduce to you the next president of the United States of America, Mitt Romney! (Cheers, applause.)",

We want (Clint/Mitt ?)! We want (Clint/Mitt ?)!\nCLINT EASTWOOD: (Chuckles.) Save a little for Mitt. (Laughter.)\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, what's a movie tradesman doing out here? You know, they're all left-wingers out there, left of Lenin. (Laughter.) At least that's what people think, but that's not really the case. There is a lot of conservative people, a lot of moderate people, Republicans, Democrats in Hollywood. It's just that conservative people, by the nature of the word itself, are 鈥� play it a little more close to vest. They don't go around hot- dogging it.\nSo 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� but they are there. Believe me, they are there. And I just 鈥� I think, in fact, there's some of them around town. I saw Jon Voight. There's a lot of people around here 鈥� (inaudible). (Cheers, applause.) Jon's here, an Academy Award winner, terrific guy. And these people are all like-minded, like all of us.\nSo I've got 鈥� I've got Mr. Obama sitting here. (Laughter.) And he's 鈥� I just was going to ask him a couple questions. But 鈥� you know, about 鈥� I remember 3 1/2 years ago when Mr. Obama won the election. And though I wasn't a big supporter, I was watching that night when he was having that thing and they were talking about hope and change, and they were talking about \"Yes, we can.\" And it was dark and 鈥� outdoors. And it was nice. And people were lighting candles, and they were saying, you know 鈥� and I just thought, this is great. I mean, everybody's crying. Oprah was crying. And 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� I was even crying. (Laughter.)\nAnd then finally 鈥� I haven't cried that hard since I found out that there's 23 million unemployed people in this country. (Cheers, applause.) And now that is something to cry for because that is a disgrace, a national disgrace. And we haven't done enough, obviously. This administration hasn't done enough to cure that. And whatever interest they have is not strong enough. And I think possibly now it may be time for somebody else to come along and solve the problem. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo, Mr. President, how do you 鈥� how do you handle 鈥� or how do you handle promises that you've made when you're running for election, and how do you handle 鈥� how do you handle it? I mean, what do you say to people? Do you 鈥� do you just 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� you know, I know people were wondering, you don't 鈥� (inaudible) 鈥� OK.\nWell, I know even some of the people in your own party who were very disappointed when you didn't close Gitmo. And I thought 鈥� well, I think closing Gitmo, why close that? We spent so much money on it.\nBut I thought maybe it's an excuse 鈥� you know, what do you mean shut up? (Laughter.) (Inaudible.) OK. It just 鈥� I thought it was just because somebody had the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown New York City. Maybe that was it. (Laughter, applause.)\nI've got a 鈥� I've got to hand it to you. I've got to give credit where credit's due. You did overrule that finally, and that's 鈥� so now we're moving onward.\nAnd I know in the 鈥� I know you were against the war in Iraq, and that's OK. But you thought the war in Afghanistan was OK. You know, I mean, you thought that was something that was worth doing. We didn't check with the Russians to see how they did there for the 10 years. (Laughter, applause.) But we did it. And it was 鈥� you know, it's something to be thought about. And I think that when we get to maybe 鈥� I think you mentioned something about having a target date for bringing everybody home.\nAnd you give that target date, and I think Mr. Romney asked the only sensible question on it. He said, why are you giving the date out now? Why don't you just bring them home tomorrow morning? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) And I thought 鈥� I thought, yeah, there's a 鈥� I'm not going to 鈥� shut up. It's my turn. (Laughter.) So anyway, we got 鈥� we're going to have 鈥� we're going to have to have a little chat about that.\nAnd then I just wondered, these 鈥� all these promises. And then I wondered about, you know, when the 鈥� what? What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that. Can't do that to himself. (Laughter.) You're crazy. You're absolutely crazy. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) You're getting as bad as Biden. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Of course, we all know Biden is 鈥� Biden is the intellect of the Democratic Party, so 鈥� (inaudible) 鈥� (laughter, cheers, applause) 鈥� we have a 鈥� just a kind of a 鈥� kind of a grin with a body behind it, you know 鈥� (inaudible) 鈥� (laughter).\nSo anyway 鈥� but I just 鈥� I just think that there's so much to be done. And I think that Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are two guys that can come along. I 鈥� see, I never thought that it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyway, because it's 鈥� (laughter, cheers, applause) 鈥� yeah.\nI think 鈥� I think attorneys are so busy 鈥� you know, they're always taught to argue everything and always weigh everything and weigh both sides, and they're always 鈥� you know, they're always 鈥� Mr. Devil's advocating this and bifurcating this and bifurcating that 鈥� you know, all of that stuff. But I think it's maybe time 鈥� what do you think 鈥� for maybe a businessman. How about that? (Cheers, applause.)\nA stellar businessman, quote-unquote, a stellar businessman. And I think it's that time. And I think if you just kind of stepped aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over 鈥� you can still use the plane 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� though maybe a smaller one, not that big gas guzzler that you're driving around when you're going around to colleges and talking about student loans and stuff like that. I think 鈥� (laughter) 鈥� you're an ecological man. Now, why would you want to drive that truck around? (Laughter.) OK.\nWell, anyway 鈥� all right, I'm sorry. I can't do that to myself, either. (Laughter, applause.) Anyway, OK.\nBut I'd just like to say something, ladies and gentlemen, something that I think is very important. It is that you 鈥� we own this country. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Yes, we own it. And it's not you owning it and not politicians owning it 鈥� politicians are employees of ours, and 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� so they're just going to come around and beg for votes every few years.\nIt's their same old deal. But I just think that it's important that you realize that 鈥� and 鈥� that you're the best in the world. And whether you're Democrat or whether you're Republican or whether you're libertarian or whatever, you're the best, and we should not ever forget that. And we 鈥� when somebody does not do the job, we've got to let them go. (Cheers, applause.) Let them go. (Cheers, applause.) (Inaudible.)\nOK. Yeah. OK. Just remember that.

I won my first gold medal in Atlanta in the summer of 1996, and I just 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� returned from the Olympics in London a few weeks ago with another gold medal. This 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� this was one of a record-setting hundred and four medals won by Team USA 鈥� (cheers) 鈥� including 58 by women, which is the most ever. I think it's safe to say we showed the world that women of America are a force to be reckoned with. (Cheers, applause.)\nI am honored to share the stage tonight with a handful of Olympic champions. Allow me to introduce them to you: Dan Jansen, an American favorite throughout four Olympiads and gold medalist. (Cheers, applause.)

USA!\nKIM RHODE: From the time when I walked into the Olympic Games in Atlanta as a wide-eyed 16-year-old, to the moment a few weeks ago when I heard our national anthem played in London as a seasoned veteran, I've seen our country both prosper, and more recently, falter. Not unlike my athletic career, there were many times when things were going very well, and times when they were not. It was in those times when things were difficult that I learned to rely on strong leadership to get me, as they would say in my world, back on target 鈥� the strong leadership of a more experienced teammate, of my coaches, and of course, most importantly, the strong leadership of my mom and dad. (Cheers, applause.)\nI came here tonight because I believe that today our country is off-target. We need the leadership of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to turn our country around 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� so that millions of Americans who have taken aim at their own dreams, whatever they may be, have the opportunity for those dreams to come true, just like our Olympic dreams did. We need strong leadership, we need new leadership and we need it now. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are here on stage because we know Americans need the leadership of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Thank you all so much, and good night. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!\nMIKE ERUZIONE: OK. Thank you. Thank you.\nGood evening. I'm Mike Eruzione. (Cheers, applause.) And I am honored to have this opportunity tonight to talk with you about the global significance of the Olympic movement, its ideals and its meaning, and how it was rescued by Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt has been over 10 years so many of you may have forgotten, but in 2002, due to bribery scandals and mismanagement, the Olympics, not just those games, but the Olympics as an institution were threatened.\nThankfully, Mitt Romney was there to salvage a desperate situation.\nMitt's leadership not only turned around those games by solving the operational and financing problems, but he did something deeper. He drew a line in the sand and said that the 2002 games would have the highest standards of ethics and integrity.\n(Cheers, applause.) He put Olympians, the athletes, and the ideals of the Olympics back at the center of the games. He focused on restoring the Olympics to the top pedestal of sports, and he preserved the opportunity and idealism of the Olympics for future generations. I was fortunate to compete in the Olympics as captain of the 1980 U.S. \"Miracle on Ice\" hockey team. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA!\nMIKE ERUZIONE: And that team 鈥� and that team was proud and honored to light the cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. That action of passing along the flame of the Olympic spirit symbolizes something grander than all of us. It is the single greatest movement that brings all humans across the world together. We are all fortunate that Mitt Romney kept that fire burning. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs a result of the 2002 Olympics, I had the opportunity to get to know Mitt and Ann Romney and to see what they have accomplished. Mitt is a brilliant leader who is committed to the highest ideals, and he is a wonderful and caring family man. Just like the Olympics needed Mitt's leadership 10 years ago, America desperately needs Mitt Romney's leadership today. (Cheers, applause.)\nPlease join me in making him the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you.\nDEREK PARRA: I'm Derek Parra. I'm a 5-foot-4 Mexican-American from Southern California. (Cheers, applause.) Now, those are just three reasons it didn't add up for me to have ever become Winter Olympic champion. (Laughter.)\nBut somehow, from inside a roller rink as a teenager, a dream grew within my heart that someday, maybe, I could represent my country at the Olympic Games. And I chased that dream for over 20 years, and eventually it led me to Salt Lake City. (Cheers, applause.) With great effort and the help of some amazing people along the way, I had become one of the top speed skaters in the world, and the finish line was in sight. But as the Olympics appeared on the horizon, that dream was almost derailed.\nThe Olympics were mired in scandal and budget deficit 鈥� and even worse, the national tragedy of September 11th that shook our entire nation to its very core. It was a time of uncertainty.\nBut in my Olympic world, Mitt Romney was at the helm. (Cheers, applause.) His vision and commitment got the games back on track and gave me the opportunity to realize my athletic dreams. Not only did Mitt facilitate my dream in 2002, he facilitated the dreams of all athletes from around the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nAt that time, I had only met Mitt briefly. But after the Olympics, I got to know him, and for a period of time I lived with him and his family.\nI know Mitt, and I know him well. I know him as a businessman and as a leader. I know him as a father and as a very, very busy grandfather. And I'm proud to say that I know him as a friend. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, you might think my greatest Olympic moment came when I stood on the podium for the first time with a gold medal wrapped around my neck. But you'd be wrong. In fact, the 鈥� my most powerful Olympic memory came before the Olympics even started. It's a story I've heard Mitt reference a number of times on the campaign trail, so I'd like to share with you firsthand what it was like for me.\nFebruary 8th, 2002, was a cold but clear night in Salt Lake City. It was the night of the opening ceremony. I was competing the very next morning, so I was planning not to attend. But that all changed the second I got the call from the U.S. Olympic Committee just hours before the ceremony asking me if I would be able to be one of the eight athletes selected to carry the World trade Center flag into the opening ceremonies. (Cheers, applause.)\nI was floored. Instantly I knew it was something I had to do, something I wanted to do. It was an honor beyond anything I could have ever imagined. And while it's now just over 10 years later, at that time our country was still reeling from the wounds, the trauma and the pain of September 11th.\nAs the opening ceremonies got under way and the flag-bearing athletes and I gathered backstage, we were standing with the Port Authority officers whose job it was to oversee the flag.\nThey began telling us how proud they were of us, that the families of the victims were proud of us, that all the people who lost their lives were proud of us.\nWhen it came time to begin the procession, I touched the flag for the first time, and I remember a physical sensation unlike anything I'd ever experienced. (Applause.) If it's possible 鈥� if it's possible to feel your soul being touched, then that's what I felt.\nAs we carried the flag out before a capacity crowd and a worldwide television audience, the silence was deafening. That flag, which has flown over so much pain and loss, still stood for life, love and the hope of a nation. (Cheers, applause.)\nThere are few times in any life when the emotion of a moment is all that exists. That night time stood still. As our national anthem rang out like never before, I stood there holding that flag, the symbol of everything our country had ever been through, with tears streaming down my face.\nThat moment came under the leadership of Mitt Romney. (Applause.) And it not only inspired me, but it inspired all of Team USA, and we went on to win a record number of medals.\nToday our country is struggling, but the right leaders can inspire us to push on, overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges and to accomplish great things.\nMitt Romney is that kind of leader. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Applause.)\nJANE EDMONDS: Thank you for the warm welcome. I am honored to be here with you tonight to share my feelings about Mitt Romney. By way of background, my politics is as a liberal Democrat. My passion is about education, workforce training and leadership.\nWhen I first met Governor Romney, I was struck by his humanity, his grace, his kind manner.\nIt was just the two of us in his office when I met him as a finalist for a Cabinet position in his administration. I could tell immediately just by our interaction that he is the real thing, authentic. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe struck me then and now as honest, transparent and inclusive. I somehow knew during that meeting that he is demanding of himself, and 鈥� (chuckles) 鈥� he'd be demanding of anyone who is part of his administration. I wanted to be around him and in that kind of environment, where my energy, skills and talents could be channeled along with others toward the public good.\nI could tell by our conversation that the governor was in office not for himself or to promote himself but for the people. (Cheers, applause.) My initial size-up of the man held true. During the four years I served in his Cabinet, I saw him up close and personal many times. And he always drove us in his administration to make government better for the people.\nOne area where he made a positive difference is in improving the representation of women in senior positions in Massachusetts state government. (Cheers, applause.)\nBefore Governor Romney took office in 2003, women were significantly underrepresented among top roles in government, with 52 percent of the population but just 30 percent of the jobs. Over the next 2 1/2 years 42 percent of the new appointments made by Governor Romney were women. (Cheers, applause.) In fact, based on a survey by the State University of New York, Massachusetts was ranked first in percentage of women holding top state positions. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis led the Boston Globe to note, women fill 10 of 20 top positions in Governor Mitt Romney's administration, making the Commonwealth one of five states that come close to matching the percentage of top women appointees to the proportion of women in the overall population. This achievement happened because Mitt Romney cared about the issue, he took action to fix it, and he delivered results. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe is unquestionably an amazing steward and leader, a servant leader and someone whom I respect very much. That's the kind of leadership that has always inspired me: unselfish leadership. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe late Stephen Covey writes about two kinds of people.\nOne type is all about themselves and their success, and the other type works as hard as they can 鈥� and certainly succeeds 鈥� but their success is motivated by doing good for others. That's how I see Governor Romney. He is authentic.\nHe is open to good ideas, wherever they come from. It doesn't matter if they're from a liberal Democrat like me. He'll listen, and he's inclusive. As a great leader, he brought out the best in me. And I know, as president, he will bring out the best in our country. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nKERRY HEALEY: Ten years ago, as chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� I flew to Salt Lake City not to see the Olympics but to meet the man who had saved them. I had a message from the grass roots: Come back to Massachusetts; our state needs you. Mitt Romney had turned around companies and turned around the Olympics. Now Massachusetts needed Mitt Romney to turn us around.\nMassachusetts was in deep trouble. We had a massive budget gap and soaring unemployment. People in my state were losing hope for themselves, their families and their children, sadly, very much like our country finds itself today.\nMitt Romney answered the call of service and accepted the challenge.\nHow did he fix our state? Well, he quickly assembled a Cabinet of the best and the brightest, drawing on both parties, Republicans and Democrats, half women, half men, to give him the full spectrum of ideas and advice. He respected different opinions. He valued open debate. And when it was all said and done, Mitt Romney knew how to make a decision. (Cheers, applause.)\nGovernor Romney did what many thought was impossible. He turned around a $3 billion budget gap and created a $2 billion rainy day fund. He even worked to streamline government but at the same time made certain to safeguard protections for the elderly, children and the homeless.\nIn education, Governor Romney gave parents more choices, insisted on tough standards for both teachers and students, and Massachusetts schools became the best in the nation. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe cleared out regulations on small businesses, and we cut taxes 19 times. (Cheers, applause.) And as a result, unemployment dropped to only 4.7 percent. And unlike President Obama, Governor Romney's economic policies were rewarded with a credit upgrade. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, those are the facts and figures, but when people find out that I served as Mitt Romney's lieutenant governor, they always ask me the same question: What's he like?\nFirst and foremost, Mitt Romney is a good and honorable man 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� committed to public service and his country. (Cheers, applause.) On the morning he took the oath of office, his first act was to focus public attention on those in need. We served breakfast to homeless veterans, encouraging voluntarism and acknowledging the special debt we owe to those who sacrifice for our country. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, you may not know this, but Mitt Romney never took a salary as governor. (Cheers, applause.) But he worked harder than anyone I know. Every morning, very early, before the rest of us arrived, Mitt would meet with his economic secretary. They worked tirelessly because for Mitt, creating jobs was his top priority. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt was always a hands-on leader. When one of Boston's tunnels collapsed, tragically killing a passenger in her car, Mitt didn't blame others. He dove in and fixed the problem. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt immersed himself in the engineering challenges, personally oversaw safety inspections, abolished cronyism and corruption and restored public confidence. (Cheers, applause.) That's the Mitt Romney I know. And he is ready to bring that same work ethic, vision and integrity to the White House. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney will never let our children's education be second- best or allow their future prosperity to be mortgaged by today's political cowardice.\nHe will respect those who build things with their own minds and their own hands. (Cheers, applause.) And Mitt Romney won't just talk about family values, he will live them every day. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd I'll tell you another thing. Mitt Romney understands that the world is safer when our country leads, and he will never apologize for America. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney will lead us back to an America we can be proud of and ahead to a future where the American dream is alive again, and within every man and woman's reach.\nThank you, Mitt Romney, for believing in America. And America, you can believe in Mitt Romney. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nRAY FERNANDEZ: Thank you. Thank you.\nThese last few months I've heard a lot of false information about Bain Capital and private equity. I'm proud to stand here and tell you what I saw when Bain Capital bought the company where I worked. The experience improved my job, and it gave me opportunities that I always believed were part of the American dream.\nIn 1996 I became a sales rep at a contact lens business called Wesley Jessen. My sales region was right here in Florida, where my parents immigrated from Cuba when I was 13 years old 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� from a country where government owns everything, but nothing works. (Cheers, applause.)\nWesley Jessen had been struggling, losing over 50 million (dollars) a year under the previous owner. Then Mitt Romney and Bain Capital came in. Bain Capital saw something others didn't see. They invested money in marketing. They brought in a charismatic and dynamic CEO, Kevin Ryan. They did everything to make the company succeed. This is the real Bain Capital 鈥� the story the Obama campaign doesn't want you to hear.\nBecause of Bain Capital's attention to management, Wesley Jessen roared back, and workers like me were inspired by what we saw, and our careers thrived.\nAnd when the company went public a few years later, I was well- rewarded. With that money, my wife, Sylvia, who's a pharmacist, and I, started our own business in Hialeah, Florida, Vida Pharmacy. (Cheers, applause.) None of this would have been possible without Bain Capital's investment (that brought ambition ?) and commitment to a struggling company. As a result, we're doing what we love: serving our community. We are building our future.\nStories like this need to be told. My life today is better because of Bain Capital. Mitt Romney helped turn around my company. I can't imagine anyone better-prepared to turn around this country. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nTOM STEMBERG: Twenty-five years ago I had a crazy idea for a new business.\nI wanted to do to office supplies what Home Depot had done with home improvement. I pictured an office superstore for regular customers and small businesses. The business would be called Staples.\nIt wasn't easy at first. I had a vision and a business plan. Then I met Mitt Romney. He helped make it come alive.\nNow, Mitt was an unusual guy. He had already enjoyed great success in Bain & Company. But he knew the value of a dollar. When I told him about Staples, he got really excited at the idea of saving a few cents on paper clips. (Laughter.)\nFunny thing. But I ask you, who would make a better president? Someone who knows how to save a dollar on pens and paper, or someone who knows how to waste $535 million on Solyndra? (Cheers, applause.)\nThe truth 鈥� the truth is Mitt was not a typical investor. He was a true partner. Where some saw an unproven new business, he saw a store that could save people money. He recognized that efficiency creates consumer value.\nAnd he never looked at Staples merely as a financial investment. He saw the engine of prosperity it would become. Today Staples employs nearly 90,000 people. It has over 2,000 stores, over 50 distribution centers. (Applause.) It is a competitive 鈥� and it is part of a competitive industry that helps entrepreneurs and small businesses get started on their own. (Cheers, applause.) For me 鈥� for me, as a founder, it was the realization of a dream.\nSo you can imagine my dismay when I see this White House and their campaign demonizing Mitt Romney, demonizing Bain Capital and demonizing the private equity industry that has created so many new jobs. (Cheers, applause.) Over and over again, fiction, half-truths and downright lies. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, you have to ask yourself, why would an administration that can't create any jobs demonize someone who did? (Laughter, applause.) I've got a theory. I think when it comes to jobs, new businesses and economic growth, they just don't get it. (Cheers, applause.) You know, they say Mitt Romney is out of touch with ordinary Americans. They just don't get it. The night before we opened the first store, I asked our people to do back-to-back all-nighters. That's when I got a phone call from Mitt. He wanted to come over and talk with the team and spend some time with them, and he told me in very clear terms: Tom, this business is all about the people.\nBut this Obama-Biden campaign, they just don't get it. They will tell you that private equity is focused only on the short term. Tell that to the founders of Bright Horizons day care, a company that has transformed corporate day care. Most people didn't give the business a chance. It went five straight years without making a profit, but Mitt and Bain Capital stood by them.\nMitt and Bain Capital believed in the vision, and they understood how important it was for women to join the workforce and have on-site day care for their children. (Cheers, applause.) It was an overdue revolution in the American workplace. Today that company employs over 19,000 people. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut President Obama and his friends, they just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: The Obama campaign will tell you that Bain Capital was a form of \"vampire capitalism,\" draining the blood from a company and move on. They just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: You know, where were they when Mitt stayed with Staples for 15 years, long after Bain Capital had sold its stock? Where were they when Bain Capital helped start Steel Dynamics when most people had given up on the American steel industry? Eighteen years later, that company employs 6,000 people. (Cheers, applause.) But this administration, they just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: You know, they've got a job council that never meets, a Democratic Senate that doesn't act, a president who doesn't believe and a vice president who just can't stop talking. (Laughter, applause.) They just don't get it.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (With speaker.) They just don't get it.\nTOM STEMBERG: And you know, they don't get it because they don't believe in the spirit of the entrepreneur. They don't understand what it means to risk money to create something new.\nAnd they don't understand the hard work it takes to get a business off the ground, the sacrifices you make, the Little League games you miss. They don't see this as a country of opportunity where someone like myself, the son of immigrants, born in Newark, New Jersey 鈥� and proud of that, Governor Christie 鈥� (cheers, applause) 鈥� can live the American dream.\nWell, let me tell you, my friend Mitt Romney gets it. (Cheers, applause.) And I could not be more confident in saying the American people get it. That's why this November they will elect Mitt Romney as the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Applause.)\nBOB WHITE: Thank you, thank you. I have a question. I have a question for you. Wasn't Ann Romney spectacular on Tuesday night? (Cheers, applause.) I agree, and Ann had some really great stories about Mitt. And so do I.\nFor 30 years I have been at Mitt Romney's side when he did extraordinary things. As Mitt says, I'm his wingman. I was there when Mitt turned around desperate situations, fixed big, broken things and had a profoundly positive impact on people's lives.\nOur journey began when Mitt asked a small group of us to help him start an investment firm called Bain Capital. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Mitt was absolutely clear what he expected from each of us. We would act with absolute integrity, mutual respect, true teammates and we would recognize the profound responsibility we owed to those who placed their trust in us. (Cheers, applause.) Integrity, respect, responsibility, trust 鈥� these are not just words to Mitt Romney.\nThese are principles he lives by. (Cheers, applause.)\nHe also applied them to the way we worked. First, he built a team. He recruited the best people he could find, reached out for ideas, encouraged dissent and fostered real cooperation.\nNext, he gave us a clarity of purpose. Our investors included pension funds, colleges and charities with noble missions. We would invest wisely, and we would treat their money as carefully as we treated our own. We would support entrepreneurs, and we would invest in troubled situations. We would help them grow and try to make their companies better. And we would be held accountable for our performance. And when things went wrong, we would not blame others. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd finally, he took decisive action. Mitt never hesitated. He made tough decisions, coalesced a team and moved forward. Time and time again I have seen this decisive leadership. When our old consulting firm was on the verge of collapse, they asked Mitt to come back and help. He answered the call. When many thought the situation was hopeless, Mitt was not deterred. I'll never forget when he said, Bob, a thousand employees and their family depend on us, and we cannot let them down.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nWhen the obstacles seemed insurmountable and others panicked, Mitt was the calm in the storm, and he never lost hope. His confidence gave us confidence. And that company not only survived, it thrived. And today Bain & Company is recognized as one of the best places to work in America. (Cheers, applause.)\nI saw something similar when Mitt was asked to help save the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. When we first realized the magnitude of the financial and management challenges, I was skeptical whether they could be saved. Mitt never doubted what could be done. He applied the same principles of leadership, and the Olympics became a story that made America proud. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd when Mitt was elected governor of Massachusetts, he asked that I help him assemble a team that would serve the public trust and be loyal to the principles he held dear. That team accomplished so much because they got Republicans and Democrats to focus on the real problems and achieve real results. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo why has Mitt taken so many challenges? It's because he runs towards problems, believes it's important to make a difference and is determined to always give something back.\nIn every pursuit, he feels a sense of responsibility and a commitment to serve.\nEven though we worked endless hours at Bain Capital, Mitt found time to serve his church and counsel people in need. And if someone needed help, Mitt was there.\nWhen our partner's daughter went missing in New York, Mitt said, we can't just stand by and do nothing; we have to go find her. He closed down our entire office, took all of us to Boston, mobilized the search efforts. (cheers, applause) 鈥� and within days, we found her, and a mom and a dad and a daughter were reunited. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt wanted us to give something back too. He inspired the formation of Bain Capital Children's Charity. It not only donated money to worthy children's causes, it got Bain Capital employees actively involved in their communities.\nGo back and look at every pursuit in Mitt's life. Surrounding him are people who have worked with him over and over again. They trust him, they respect him, they want to be part of his team, and they want to be part of the change. And today we need urgent change in Washington. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd we need 鈥� we need a proven leader with passion and compassion. I have seen Mitt Romney be that leader. He is the right man at the right time to be the next president of the United States.\nThank you very much. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Applause.)\nTED OPAROWSKY: Evening, folks.\nMy wife and I are people of modest means. I made my living as a professional firefighter for 27 years. (Cheers, applause.) Prior to moving to Randolph, Vermont, we lived in Medford, Massachusetts. (Cheers, applause.) It was there we met Mitt Romney and his family.\nIt's been over 30 years since we have lost our son David. The memories are still vivid and painful. But we wanted to share them with you because David's story is a part of Mitt's story, and America deserves to hear it.\nBack in the early 1970s, Mitt visited our home numerous times, with his oldest son Tagg tagging along. He was in the vanguard of our support system when we received the news that no parent is prepared to confront. You cannot measure a man's character based on the words he utters before adoring crowds during times that are happy. The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble, the quiet hospital room of a dying boy, with no cameras and no reporters.\nThis is the time to make that assessment.\nIn 1979 a tragedy struck our family when our youngest son, David, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a 鈥� it was a cancer.\nPAT OPAROWSKY: Over a period of seven months he was in and out of Children's Hospital in Boston for treatment. Throughout that agonizing period, Mitt took time from his busy schedule to visit David. They developed a loving friendship. On one of his visits, Mitt discovered that David was very fond of fireworks. He went out and bought a box full of big-time fireworks that had to sit on the closet shelf because they couldn't be set off in the city. We waited until we were able to go to Ogunquit, Maine, where we set them off on the sand dunes, with permission from the fire and police departments. (Laughter.)\nThrough that simple but thoughtful gift, Mitt brought joy to a young boy who had experienced any 鈥� had not experienced any for too long. He also gave the rest of us a welcome relief. On another visit, David, knowing Mitt had gone to law school at Harvard, asked Mitt if he would help him write a will. He had some prized possessions he wanted to make sure were given to his closest friends and family.\nThe next time Mitt went to the hospital, he was equipped with his yellow legal pad and pen. Together, they made David's will. That is a task that no child should ever have to do, but it gave David peace of mind.\nSo after David's death, we were able to give his skateboard, his model rockets and his fishing gear to his best friends. He also made it clear that his brother Peter should get his Ruger 22 rifle.\nHow many men do you know would take the time out of their busy lives to visit a terminally ill 14-year-old and help him settle his affairs?\nDavid also helped us plan his funeral. He wanted to be buried in his Boy Scout uniform. He wanted Mitt to pronounce his eulogy, and Mitt was there to honor that request.\nWe will be ever grateful to Mitt for his love and concern. (Cheers, applause.)\nTED OPAROWSKY: We humbly wish that God will continue to bless Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in their efforts. In doing so, he will bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nPAM FINLAYSON: In 1982, my husband, Grant, and I moved from California to Massachusetts with our newborn son. Being a church- going family, we looked for the nearest chapel and soon found ourselves in a congregation led by a clearly bright and capable man named Mitt Romney.\nI knew Mitt was special from the start.\nAt the time, we didn't own a dryer, and the day he stopped by to welcome us, I was embarrassed to have laundry hanging all over the house. But Mitt wasn't fazed. In fact, as we spoke, without a word, he joined me and actually started helping, helpfully plucking clothes from around the house and folding them. By the time Mitt left, not only did I feel welcome, my laundry was done. (Laughing.)\nAs Grant and I juggled school, jobs, church and family, we grew to love the Romneys. They became role models and friends, and we were honored when Mitt and Ann regularly trusted us to stay with their five rambunctious but very loving sons when they traveled. It was when our daughter Kate was born three and a half months early, however, that I fully came to appreciate what a great treasure of friendship we had in Mitt and Ann.\nKate was so tiny and very sick, her lungs not yet ready to breathe, her heart unstable. And after suffering a severe brain hemorrhage at three days old, she was teetering on the very edge of life.\nAs I sat with her in intensive care, consumed with a mother's worry and fear, dear Mitt came to visit and pray with me. As our clergy, he was one of very few visitors allowed. And I will never forget how when he looked down tenderly at my daughter, his eyes filled with tears and he reached out and gently stroked her tiny back.\nI could tell immediately that he didn't just see a tangle of plastic in tubes and wires. He saw our beautiful little girl. And he was clearly overcome with compassion for her.\nDuring the many months that our Kate was hospitalized, the Romneys often cared for our 2-year-old son Peter. They treated him like one of their own, like a sick son. They gave him a nickname and even welcomed him to stay the night when needed.\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Kate was still struggling for life. Brain surgery was scheduled, and the holiday was the furthest thing from our minds. But that morning I opened my door to find Mitt and his boys, arms loaded down with a Thanksgiving feast. Of course, we were overcome. When I called to thank Ann later, she sweetly confessed it had been Mitt's idea that most of the shopping and cooking and chopping had been done by him. She and the boys had just happily pitched in.\nEventually we moved from Boston. Our daughter Kate grew into an amazing girl of faith and love. (Cheers, applause.) But complications of her birth remained with her. And after 26 years of both miracles and struggle, she passed away just a year and a half ago.\nIn the midst of making the final decision to run for president, which had to be the most difficult of their lives, when they heard of Kate's passing, both Mitt and Ann paused to personally reach out to us and extend us sympathy and express their love. It seems to me when it comes to loving our neighbor, we can talk about it, or we can live it.\nThe Romneys live it every single day. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen the world looks at Mitt Romney, they may see him as the founder of a successful business, the leader of the Olympic Games or a governor. But when I see Mitt Romney, I know him to be a loving father, a man of faith and a caring and compassionate friend. It is with great excitement and renewed hope that I think of how our country will be blessed as it is led by a man who is not only so very accomplished and capable, but who has devoted his entire life quietly serving others. That man is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nGRANT BENNETT: I have been blessed to spend thousands of hours over many years with a dear friend and remarkable man named Mitt Romney. These wonderful, even glorious, hours together were spent in serving our fellow men and women. They were spent in service in our church. (Cheers, applause.) We embraced Christ's admonition, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which we are members, has an unpaid lay clergy.\nWhile raising his family and pursuing his career, Mitt Romney served in our church, devoting 10, 15 and even 20 hours a week doing so. Like all Mormon leaders, he did so on his own time and at his own expense. (Cheers, applause.)\nI was Mitt's assistant when he was our pastor. I had a front-row seat, and it was marvelous to behold. As we began working together, Mitt asked, how early can I call you in the morning? I answered, 6:00 a.m. I regret my answer. (Laughter.) Mitt Romney became my alarm clock.\nA typical morning call: Grant, it's Mitt. I'm at the airport. Hazel Young (sp) tripped last night and bruised her hip. Please visit her this evening. Give her my love. I'll arrange for meals, and I will visit her on my way home from the airport tomorrow.\nIn our early morning calls, Mitt didn't discuss questions of theology. He found the definition of religion given by James in the New Testament to be a practical guide. Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo what specifically did Mitt Romney do as our pastor? For one or two evenings each week and several hours every weekend, week after week and year after year, he met with those seeking help with the burdens of real life, burdens we all face at one time or another: unemployment, sickness, financial distress, loneliness.\nMitt prayed and counseled with church members seeking spiritual direction: single mothers raising children, couples with marital problems, youth with addictions, immigrants separated from their families and individuals whose heat had been shut off. To uphold the dignity and respect the privacy of those who came, he met with them in private and in confidence. He has upheld that trust. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt's response to those who came was compassion in all its beautiful varieties. He had a listening ear and a helping hand. Drawing on the skills and resources of those in our congregation, Mitt provided food and housing, rides to the doctor and companions to sit with those who were ill. He shoveled snow and raked leaves for the elderly. He took down tables and swept floors at church dinners. He was often the last to leave.\nYears later I became the pastor.\nOnly then did I understand the dedication this calling requires and the clarity this service provides into the full range of our shared human experience. Mitt challenged each of us to find our life by losing it in service to others. He issued that challenge again and again. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe church itself was a marvelous vehicle for extending that challenge. Mitt seldom delivered the sermon himself; he gave that opportunity to fellow church members. He sought to involve everyone so everyone could grow. Mitt taught faith in God, personal integrity, self-reliance and service to our fellow men. (Applause.) And Mitt did what he challenged us to do; he led by example. (Cheers, applause.)\nI treasure every minute we serve together. I am grateful for my apprenticeship in the things that matter most under the hands of a deeply good man named Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt is my privilege to introduce two families from our congregation: first, Pat and Ted Oparowsky. They will be followed by Pam Finlayson. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nJEB BUSH: Thank you. Thank you all very much. (Cheers, applause.) Thanks. Thank you. Welcome to Florida. (Cheers, applause.) Bienvenidos a nuestra querida Florida. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nBefore I begin my remarks, I have something personal I'd like to share with you. I've been so blessed to be part of a family that has committed its life to public service. My granddad 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爉y grandfather and my father have been incredible role models for me and served our country honorably.\nAnd my brother? Well, I love my brother. (Cheers, applause.) He is a man of integrity, courage and honor. And during incredibly challenging times, he kept us safe. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo Mr. President 鈥斅燤r. President, it is time to stop blaming your predecessor for your failed economic policies. (Cheers, applause.) You were dealt a tough hand. You were dealt a tough hand, but your policies have not worked. In the fourth year of your presidency, a real leader would accept responsibility for his actions, and you haven't done it.\nNow 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爊ow that I've gotten that off of my chest, let's talk a little bit about our kids and education.\nThis election is about the future of this nation. We can shape that future with what we do here, with what we do on November 6th. We can restore America's greatness. That starts with a strong economy, a smart energy policy, lower deficits and a president who puts America's workers and job creators first.\nBut to have a great future, a secure future, a future that is equal to our potential as a nation, we need to do something else.\nWe must make sure that our children and grandchildren are ready for the world we are shaping today. (Cheers, applause.) It starts 鈥斅爄t starts in our homes, in our communities and especially in our schools.\nAs a candidate and governor, I visited over 400 Florida schools. I saw children read for their first sentences, solve their first long division problems, explore the miracles of chemistry and physics. That's the essence of education: students getting a chance at a future.\nThere are many reasons to believe America's future is bright, but also reasons to worry. Of 34 advanced nations in the world, American students rank 17th in science, 25th in math. Only one quarter of high school graduates are ready for their next steps. China and India produce eight times more engineering students each years than the United States. This is a moral cost to our country. Our failing schools need to be fixed. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe say that every child in America has an equal opportunity. But tell that to a kid in whose classroom learning isn't respected. Tell that to a parent stuck in a school where there is no leadership. Tell that to a young talented teacher who just got laid off because she didn't have tenure. The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools. We give some kids a chance, but not all. That failure is the great moral and economic issue of our time, and it is hurting all of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nI believe we can meet this challenge. We need to set high standards for students and teachers, and provide students and their parents the choices they deserve.\nThe first step is a simple one. We must stop prejudging children based on their race, ethnicity or household income. (Cheers, applause.) We must stop excusing failure in our schools and start rewarding improvement and success. (Cheers, applause.) We must have high academic standards that are benchmarked to the best in the world.\nYou see, all kids can learn. Governor Romney believes it, and the data proves it. While he was governor, Massachusetts raised standards, and today their students lead the nation in academic performance. (Cheers, applause.)\nHere in Florida, in 1999 we were at the bottom of the nation in education. For the last decade the state has been on a path of reform. Under the leadership of Governor Rick Scott and local leaders, our focus every day is whether students are learning. That's it. (Cheers, applause.)\nToday more students are reading on grade level, passing rigorous college prep courses and graduating from high school. And perhaps most exciting, those traditionally left behind are showing the greatest gains. Among African-American students, Florida is ranked fourth in the nation for academic improvement. Among low-income students 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爓e're ranked third for our gains. Among students with disabilities, we're ranked first. And among Latino students 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐he gains were so big they require a new metric. Right now Florida's fourth-grade Hispanic students read as well or better than the average of all students in 21 states and the District of Columbia. (Cheers, applause.)\nThese kids 鈥斅爐hese kids were once written off. But today, thanks to teachers like Sean Duffy, we're changing that.\n(Applause.)\nSEAN DUFFY: I'm honored to be an educator, to help the next generation of leaders, thinkers, builders and entrepreneurs. Sadly, I'm part of a dwindling field. I've seen too many good teachers come and go, mainly due to poor working conditions and little pay. Bad teachers get locked into the system, and good teachers leave for more money.\nOn top of the bureaucratic challenges, what we're teaching doesn't always match what our students actually need. To that end, I helped launch a STEM lab at my high school. These labs focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics and help students learn proficiency in these fields.\nWe turn students away from education each year by not providing a robust curriculum that helps keep 鈥斅爐hat keeps up with the world in which these students live and will eventually work. And at the end of the day, all of what we do, from the educators to the policymakers, has to be student-focused and student-centered. (Cheers, applause.) After all, students matter most, and that's what counts.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nJEB BUSH: Thank you, Sean. I know that Del Valle High School is proud of your efforts, and we need more great teachers like you, teachers who don't give up on a kid, who recognize that every child can learn and don't waste a precious year of a student's life. If you're a great teacher and your students are mastering their subjects, no matter your age or years of experience, you should have a job. Education is hard work, but if you follow some core principles and you challenge the status quo, you can get great results.\nSo here's another thing we could do: Let's give every parent in America a choice about where their child's 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼ttends school.\nLook 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爀verywhere in our lives, we get a chance to choose. Go down any supermarket aisle, and you'll find an incredible selection of milk. You can get whole milk, buttermilk, 2 percent milk, lowfat milk or skim milk, organic milk and milk with extra vitamin D. There's flavored milk, chocolate, strawberry or vanilla, and it doesn't even taste like milk. They even make milk for people who can't drink milk. (Laughter.) So my question to you is shouldn't parents have that kind of choice in schools that best meets the needs of their students? (Cheers, applause.)\nGovernor Romney gets it. Mitt Romney gets it. He believes parents, regardless of zip code or income, should be able to send their child to the school that fits them best. That has set him up against some entrenched interests. There are many people who say they support strong schools but draw the line at school choice. Sorry, kid, giving you equal opportunity would be too risky, and it would upset powerful political forces that we need to win elections. I have a simple message for these masters of delay and deferral: Choose. You can either help the politically powerful unions, or you can help the kids. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, for those that have been involved in this, you know it's hard to take on the unions. They fund campaigns. They're well- organized. Election day, they'll show up.\nMeanwhile, the kids aren't old enough to vote. But you and I know who deserves a choice. Governor Romney knows it, too.\nLet me introduce you to Frantz Placide. Because we gave him a choice, he got a great election. (Cheers, applause.)\nFRANTZ PLACIDE: I grew up in the inner city of Miami, in a place where your ZIP code determines your chances of success. My only option was an unproductive and failing school. I knew that could lead to an unproductive and failing future.\nThank to Governor Bush's school choice program, I got the chance to choose a better school. Making my education my priority, I enrolled at one of the toughest high schools in Miami, Archbishop Curley Notre Dame. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm sure, like a lot of us, it was my mother Carlette (sp) who really pushed for a choice in my education. I'm glad she did. Her devotion to my future has given me a chance to succeed. I've graduated from Wagner College, and I'm looking forward to a life of learning and serving my community. (Cheers, applause.)\nWho knows what the future would have held if I didn't have a choice in my education? But I do know the numbers for failure, and I probably wouldn't have a good chance.\nGovernor Bush's school choice program gave me a chance to achieve academic success in a school that was best-fit for me. I took it from there. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nJEB BUSH: Thank you, Frantz. It is an incredible honor to see you grow up. And Frantz's story is 鈥斅燼nd many others 鈥斅爄s a driving force across this nation to bring about necessary change.\nAnd some of the biggest reformers are Republicans. Governor Mitch Daniels in Indiana and Bobby Jindal in Louisiana have expanded school choice from what we have here in Florida. (Cheers, applause.) Governor Martinez in New Mexico is raising expectations, holding schools accountable for students gaining critical reading skills. Governor LePage in Maine and Deal in Georgia are transforming education by pushing schools to harness the power of technology and digital learning. (Cheers.) Idaho Governor Otter and Superintendent Luna are raising up the best teachers 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅燼nd separating out the ineffective ones. That earned them some enemies. Some of them slashed the superintendent's tires. But he didn't back down. (Applause.)\nGovernor Scott Walker in Wisconsin led his state 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燝overnor Walker led his state to adopt reforms that promote early literacy and require that teacher evaluations incorporate student achievement. In Nevada, Governor Sandoval pushed for reforms to end the damaging practice of \"last in, first out,\" where teachers are hired or fired based on their years in the system, not their impact in the classroom. Governor Haslam in Tennessee is making sure every classroom has an effective teacher. (Cheers, applause.)\nBecause he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement. In Massachusetts 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燝overnor Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards and put into place a merit scholarship 鈥斅燭he John and Abigail Adams Scholarship 鈥斅爐o give students four tuition-free years at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. (Cheers, applause.) He is a champion for bringing hope to education, and he intends to be a champion for equality of opportunity 鈥斅燼 president who always puts students first.\nSo in this election, remember this: Our future as a nation is at stake. Fact is this election is not just about one office; it's about one nation. If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promise them: an equal opportunity. That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live. And it starts with electing Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. God bless you. God bless our excellent teachers, and God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",

El es un gran esposo, padre y abuelo. El sabe como unir a nuestro pais y valora que somos una nacion de inmigrantes unidos en el deseo de lograr el suenio (ph) americano. El ama a nuestra nacion. El luchara para confrontar los retos que tenemos y restaurar la grandeza de los Estados Unidos.\nIt's easy to forget 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅爐hank you. (Cheers, applause.) It's easy to forget that the story of my father's success begins with the story of two immigrants. Thank you.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMy grandfathers, who came to this country with little more than hope and the opportunity of America, through their hard work and perseverance, they lived the American dream. They gave opportunities to their children they wouldn't have had anywhere else. The Republican Party is dedicated to preserving that opportunity for all Americans. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe've had the privilege of hearing about different chapters of the same inspiring story from Governors Sandoval and Martinez and soon-to-be Senator Cruz. We're seeing this story play out in the lives of many other Hispanic-Americans who have become leaders in the Republican party and throughout our nation. These leaders, along with Hispanics across the country, play a vital role in the Romney-Ryan comeback as we fight to put America back on the path to prosperity.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Thank you. Thank you for that warm welcome. What a wonderful tribute to President Reagan and the spirit of the American people.\nNEWT GINGRICH: It's fantastic to see so many friends here, friends from decades of service to the party, service in public life and those who have helped us over the past few years. And we are delighted that tonight we come together to once again renew the American spirit and put real leadership back in the White House this November.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: The election of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will decisively move America to a better future. Remembering President Reagan reminds us that the choices we make matter. And this year is as important as the choice we made in 1980.\nNEWT GINGRICH: Over three decades have passed since Ronald Reagan was first elected to the White House. Yet the impact of his leadership is still evident today. While in office, President Reagan had three major goals: to restore the economy, to revive the American spirit and to defeat totalitarianism, spreading democracy throughout the world.\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: By remaining true to his convictions through his belief in the American people and with tremendous optimism, President Reagan achieved these goals.\nNEWT GINGRICH: It's striking how President Carter and President Obama both took our nation down a path that in four years weakened America's confidence in itself and our hope for a better future.\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Both weakened the respect for America abroad. Both increased government programs filled with waste and inefficiency that failed to produce results. Both made promises they couldn't keep. And as a consequence of ineffective policies, both were unable to revive our economy and create jobs.\nNEWT GINGRICH: For example, both crippled American energy production when there were better ways to develop and use our abundant energy resources.\nThe Romney plan for North American energy independence is exactly the kind of bold visionary leadership Reagan believed in, and it is what we need now. (Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: The Reagan presidency also teaches us that there is a better way to put Americans back to work, create millions of jobs and help every American achieve success. The Reagan program of tax cuts, regulatory reform and spending controls worked.\nNEWT GINGRICH: Reagan's belief in small business owners and entrepreneurs is a remarkable contrast with Obama's class warfare rhetoric, massive deficits and a passion for taxing those who create jobs. The Romney plan for a stronger middle class has deep roots in Ronald Reagan's approach.\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Reagan's commitment to reform welfare and to create a work requirement was a major achievement when he was governor of California. His pioneering work led to the historic welfare reform bill Congress and the president passed 30 years later. This bipartisan legislation reduced the size of government, made our country more competitive and put millions of Americans back to work. (Cheers, applause.)\nNEWT GINGRICH: Tragically, President Obama gutted this achievement, and like Jimmy Carter, over four years he produced little effective legislation that brought the two parties together in the interest of the nation.\nObama's waiving of the work requirements in welfare reform is just one example of his direct repudiation of President Reagan's values.\nObama's proud of what he's done, and of his politically motivated partisanship. But he should be ashamed for putting politics before people. (Cheers, applause.)\nCALLISTA GINGRICH: Governor Romney will return America to work and to the principles that are at the core of President Reagan's legacy. This year the American people will once again have an important choice to make.\nNEWT GINGRICH: Now each of us must commit ourselves, in the tradition of Ronald Reagan, to come together. President Reagan said there is no substitute for victory. And this November we cannot settle for anything less. This 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐his is the most critical election of our lifetime. Each of us must do our part now to ensure that America remains, in the tradition of President Reagan, a land of freedom, hope and opportunity.\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\CONNIE MACK: Once again it's morning in America.\nThere are new leaders on the horizon: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, America's comeback team. (Cheers, applause.)\nGrowing up, I had a plaque on my wall that read: Life's battles don't always go to the fastest or the strongest. Sooner or later those who win are those who think they can. We've always been a people with big dreams and limitless potential. After all, this is America. (Cheers, applause.)\nOur success is built on our values and our principles. But so many of them are under attack. Our commitment to freedom and liberty and to everything that makes our country great seems to embarrass the \"blame America first\" crowd. They penalize individual achievement, praising the power of government, but they have not, cannot and will not destroy our spirit. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are proud to be Americans, we are proud of our nation, we are proud of our heritage, and we are proud of our success. It is our commitment to the American story. It's our athletes in London who brought home more medals than any other country, even China. (Cheers, applause.) It's our best and our brightest who landed an extraordinary rover on Mars. It's Nobel Prize winners, scientists, writers, artists second to none who inspire us all. These are the achievements that are brought about by a free society that honors individual effort.\nWe owe it to those who have given so much to regain our strength and remain the strongest force for freedom the world has ever seen.\nOur allies deserve an unwavering support. And our enemies need to know we stand to defend freedom at all costs. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica was built on the belief in free enterprise, hard work, passion and faith. We have the awesome responsibility to make that dream a reality. That dream is not an impossible dream. It's the American dream. It's sure, it's strong and it's steady.\nMitt Romney's plans to restore America's promise and purpose will be realized, and the American dream will once again be available to all her children. We are a nation of dreamers 鈥斅燞enry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the Wright Brothers, dreamers like Neil Armstrong who sought new lands and took giant leaps into American exceptionalism, and dreamers like my friend Kiko Villalon. You know the stories of the other. Now let me tell you the story of Kiko.\nIn 1960, Kiko fled Castro's Cuba. He came to New York. He became a taxi driver. He worked hard and saved his money. He became a citizen. He moved to Florida. He started a business building boats. He raised a family. He put his children through school. He sold his business. Now he worries about what opportunities lie ahead for his children and their children.\nKiko has lived the American dream, as have so many others.\nThat's what this election is all about: making the American dream a reality again. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt's not about the past. It's not about what was done wrong. It's not about blaming America. It's quite the opposite. Tonight we embark on a renewal of the American dream. Tonight we honor those who have come before and done so much, many even giving their lives. And tonight we honor our children and their children, to ensure their dreams, whether it's playing under the lights or starting a business or being a doctor or a nurse or a soldier or a sailor or even a president or vice president. Dreams can come 鈥斅燽ecome realities. After all, this is America, and it's morning once again.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.) God bless America. God bless you. Thank you. I love you, Florida! (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nPAUL RYAN: Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, Wisconsin. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) (Chuckles.) You guys are great. Thanks so much. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\nMr. Chairman 鈥斅燤r. Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens, I am honored by the support of this convention for vice president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nI accept the duty to help lead our nation out of a jobs crisis and back to prosperity. And I know we can do this. (Cheers, applause.)\nI accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old. And I know that we are ready. Our nominee is sure ready. (Cheers, applause.) His whole life 鈥斅爃is whole life prepared him for this moment, to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words. After four years of getting the runaround, America needs a turnaround. And the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm the newcomer to this campaign. So let me share a first impression. I have never seen opponents so silent about their record and so desperate to keep their power. They've run out of ideas. Their moment came and went. Fear and division is all they've got left. With all their attack ads, the president is just throwing away money. And he's pretty experienced at that. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou see, some people can't be dragged down by the usual cheap tactics because their character, ability and plain decency are so obvious.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nFor my part, your nomination is an unexpected turn. It certainly came as news to my family. (Laughter.) And I'd like you to meet them: my best friend and wife, Janna, our daughter Liza, and our boys Charlie and Sam. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe kids are happy to see their grandma who lives in Florida. There she is, my mom Betty. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I'd like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know what? I'm sure proud of him and where I come from: Janesville, Wisconsin. (Cheers, applause.)\nI live on the same block where I grew up. We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place. The people of Wisconsin have been good to me. I've tried to live up to their trust. And now, I ask those hardworking men and women and millions like them across America to join our cause and get this country working again.\n(Cheers, applause.) When Governor Romney asked me to join the ticket, I said, let's get this done, and that is exactly what we are going to do. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Barack Obama came to office during an economic crisis, as he has reminded us a time or two. (Laughter.) Those were very tough days, and any fair measure of his record has to take that into account. My own state voted for President Obama. When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, Candidate Obama said, I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years. That's what he said in 2008.\nWell, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that's how it is in so many towns, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight. Right now, 23 million men and women are struggling to find work, 23 million people unemployed or underemployed. Nearly 1-in-6 Americans is in poverty.\nMillions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for or any work at all. So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years? (Cheers, applause.)\nThe first troubling sign came with the stimulus. It was President Obama's first and best shot at fixing the economy at a time when he got 鈥斅爃e got everything he wanted under one-party rule. It cost $831 billion, the largest one-time expenditure every by our federal government. It went to companies like Solyndra, with their gold-plated connections, subsidized jobs and make-believe markets. The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right. (Cheers, applause.)\nPAUL RYAN: You, you the American people of this country, were cut out of the deal. What did taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted. It was borrowed, spent and wasted. (Cheers, applause.)\nMaybe the greatest waste of all was time.\nHere we were, faced with a massive job crisis so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent. You would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation and nothing else his first order of economic business. But this president didn't do that. Instead we got a long, divisive, all-or- nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care. (Boos.) \"Obamacare\" comes to more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country. (Extended cheers, applause.) That's right. That's right. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know what, the president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal \"Obamacare.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd the biggest, coldest power play of all in \"Obamacare\" came at the expense of the elderly. You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with the new law and new taxes on nearly a small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn't have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. So they just took it all away from Medicare 鈥斅�$716 billion funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. (Boos.) An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed all to pay for anew entitlement we didn't even ask for. (Applause.)\nThe greatest threat to Medicare is \"Obamacare,\" and we're going to stop it. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn Congress, when they take out the heavy books and the wall charts about Medicare, my thoughts go back to a house on Garfield Street in Janesville. My wonderful grandma, Janet (sp), had Alzheimer's, and she moved in with Mom and me. Though she felt lost at times, we did all the little things that made her feel loved. We had help from Medicare, and it was there, just like it's there for my mom today. Medicare is a promise, and we will honor it. A Romney- Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare for my mom's generation, for my generation and for my kids and yours. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn't going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate! (Cheers, applause.)\n\"Obamacare,\" as much as anything else, explains why a presidency that we 鈥斅爐hat began with such anticipation now comes to such a disappointing close. It began with a financial crisis. It ends with a job crisis. It began with a housing crisis they alone didn't cause. It ends with a housing crisis they didn't correct. (Cheers, applause.) It began with a perfect AAA credit rating for the United States. It ends with a downgraded America. (Boos.)\nIt all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new. Now all that's left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, President Obama was asked not long ago to reflect on any mistakes he might have made. He said, well, I haven't communicated enough. (Laughter.) He said his job is to, quote, tell a story to the American people, as if that's the whole problem here. (Laughter.) He needs to talk more, and we need to be better listeners? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, these past four years we have suffered no shortage of words in the White House. What is missing is leadership in the White House. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd the story 鈥斅燼nd the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old.\n(Cheers, applause.) The man assumed office almost four years ago. Isn't it about time he assumed responsibility? (Cheers, applause.) Yeah. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time. Back in 2008 Candidate Obama called a $10 trillion national debt unpatriotic 鈥斅爏erious talk from what looked like a serious reformer. Yet by his own decisions, President Obama has added more debt than any other president before him and more than all the troubled governments of Europe combined. One president, one term, 5 trillion (dollars) in new debt. (Boos.)\nHe created a new bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing. (Boos.) Republicans 鈥斅燫epublicans stepped up with good faith reforms and solutions equal to the problems. How did the president respond? By doing nothing 鈥斅爊othing except to dodge and demagogue the issue. So here we are, $16 trillion in debt, and still he does nothing. In Europe massive debts have put entire governments at risk of collapse, and still he does nothing. And all we have heard from this president and his team are attacks on anyone who dares to point out the obvious. They have no answer to this simple reality.\nWe need to stop spending money we don't have. (Cheers, applause.) Really simple. Not that hard. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy dad used to say to me, son, you have a choice. You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution. The present administration has made its choices, and Mitt Romney and I have made ours. Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation's economic problems. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd I'm going to level with you: we don't have that much time. But if we are serious and smart, and we lead, we can do this. After four years of government trying to divide up the wealth, we will get America creating wealth again. (Cheers, applause.) With tax fairness and regulatory reform, we'll put government back on the side of men and women who create jobs and the men and women who need jobs.\nMy mom started a small business, and I've seen what it takes. Mom was 50 when my dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison.\nShe earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn't just a new livelihood; it was a new life. And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small-business woman whose happiness wasn't just in the past. Her work gave her hope. It made our family proud. And to this day my mom is my role model. (Cheers, applause.)\nBehind every small business, there's a story worth knowing. All the corner shops in our towns and cities, the restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores 鈥斅爐hese didn't come out of nowhere. A lot of heart goes into each one. And if small-business people say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else works seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at 5:00 in the morning. Nobody did their thinking and worrying and sweating for them.\nAfter all that work and in a bad economy, it sure doesn't help to hear from their president that government gets the credit. What they deserve to hear is the truth: Yes, you did build that. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe have a plan for a stronger middle class, with a goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years. (Applause.) In a clean break 鈥斅爄n a clean break from the Obama years, and frankly, from the years before this president, we will keep federal spending at 20 percent of GDP or less, because that is enough. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe choice 鈥斅爐he choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government. (Cheers, applause.)\nI learned a good deal about economics and about America from the author of the Reagan tax reforms, the great Jack Kemp. (Cheers, applause.) What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people and the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.\nAnd in our dealings with other nations, a Romney-Ryan administration will speak with confidence and clarity. Whenever men and women rise up for their own freedom, they will know that the American president is on their side. (Cheers, applause.)\nInstead 鈥斅爄nstead of managing American decline, leaving allies to doubt us and adversaries to test us, we will act in the conviction that the United States is still the greatest force for peace and liberty that this world has ever known. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nPAUL RYAN: President Obama is the kind of politician who puts promises on the record and then (calls ?) back the record. (Laughter.) But we are four years into this presidency. The issue is not the economy that Barack Obama inherited, not the economy that he envisions but this economy that we are living. (Cheers, applause.)\nCollege graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life. (Cheers, applause.)\nEveryone 鈥斅爀veryone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now.\nAnd I hope you understand this too. If you're feeling left out or passed by, you have not failed. Your leaders have failed you. (Cheers, applause.) None of us 鈥斅爊one of us should have to settle for the best this administration offers: a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next; a government-planned life; a country where everything is free but us. (Cheers, applause.)\nListen to the way we're already spoken to. (Cheers, applause.) Listen to the way we are spoken to already, as if everyone is stuck in some class or station in life, victims of circumstances beyond our control, with the government there to help us cope with our fate. It's the exact opposite of everything I learned growing up in Wisconsin or at college in Ohio. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, when I was waiting tables, washing dishes or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey, where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself. That's what we do in this country. (Cheers, applause.) That's the American dream. (Cheers, applause.) That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!\nPAUL RYAN: By themselves 鈥斅燽y themselves, the failures of one administration are not a mandate for a new administration.\nA challenger must stand on his own merits. He must be ready and worthy to serve in the office of president. We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I, and in some ways we're different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus 鈥斅�(laughter) 鈥斅燼nd I've heard it on many hotel elevators. (Laughter, applause.) He actually 鈥斅爃e actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies. I said, look, I hope it's not a dealbreaker, Mitt 鈥斅�(laughter) 鈥斅燽ut my playlist, it starts with AC/DC and it ends with Zeppelin. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook, a generation apart 鈥斅燼 generation apart, but that doesn't matter. It makes us different, but not in any of the things that matter. Mitt Romney and I both grew up in the heartland, and we know what places like Wisconsin and Michigan look like 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅爓hen times are good. (Cheers, applause.) We know what these communities look like when times are good, when people are working, when families are doing more than just getting by. And we know it can be that way again.\nWe've had very different careers, mine mainly in public services, his mostly in the private sector. He helped start businesses and turn around failing ones. And by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt 鈥斅燤itt has not only succeeded, but he succeeded where others could not. He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending and corruption. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it? (Laughter.) He was a Republican governor of a state where almost 9- in-10 legislators are Democrats. And yet he balanced the budget without raising taxes. (Cheers, applause.) Unemployment went down. Household incomes went up. And Massachusetts under Governor Mitt Romney saw its credit rating upgraded. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt and I also go to different churches. But in any church, the best kind of preaching is done by example. And I've been watching that example. (Cheers, applause.) The man who will accept your nomination tomorrow is prayerful and faithful and honorable. Not only a defender of marriage, he 鈥斅爃e offers an example of marriage at its best. (Cheers, applause.) Not only a fine businessman, he's a fine man 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爓orthy of leading this optimistic and good-hearted country.\nOur faiths come together in the same moral creed. We believe that in every life, there is goodness; for every person, there is hope. Each one of us was made for a reason, bearing the image and likeness of the lord of life. (Cheers, applause)\nWe have responsibilities, one to another. We do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves. (Cheers, applause.)\nEach of these moral ideas 鈥斅爀ach of these moral ideas is essential to democratic government, to the rule of law, to life in a humane and decent society. They are the moral creed of our country, as powerful in our time as on the day of America's founding. They are self-evident and unchanging. And sometimes even presidents need reminding that our rights come from nature and God and not from government! (Cheers, applause.)\nThe founding generation secured those rights for us. And in every generation since, the best among us have defended our freedoms. They are protecting us right now. We honor them and all of our veterans, and we thank them. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders. And you are entitled to the clearest possible choice, because the time for choosing is drawing near.\nSo here is our pledge. We will not duck the tough issues. We will lead. We will not spend four years blaming others. We will take responsibility. (Applause.) We will not try to replace our founding principles. We will reapply our founding principles. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of all of us 鈥斅燼ll of us, but we can do this. We can do this. Together we can do this. We can get this country working again. We can get this economy growing again. (Cheers, applause.) We can make the safety safe again. (Cheers, applause.) We can do this. Whatever your political party, let's come together for the sake of our country. Join Mitt Romney and me. (Cheers, applause.) Let's give this effort everything we have. (Cheers, applause.) Let's see this thing all the way through. Let's get this done. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless you all. Thank you. (Cheers, applause continue.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nSUSANA MARTINEZ: Thank you, and good evening. Before I begin tonight, let's keep in our prayers the families impacted by the storm affecting the Gulf Coast. If you haven't done so already, please donate to the Red Cross. To find out more about how you can help those affected by Hurricane Isaac, please visit redcross.org/give.\nI am Susana Martinez. On behalf of the great state of New Mexico, let me express my gratitude for being invited to speak tonight. Growing up, I never imagined a little girl from a border town could one day become a governor. But this is America. En America, todo es posible. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy parents taught me to never give up and to always believe that my future could be whatever I dreamt it to be. Success, they taught me, is built on the foundation of courage, hard work and individual responsibility. Despite what some would have us believe, success is not built on resentment and fear. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe grew up on the border and truly lived paycheck to paycheck. My dad was a Golden Gloves boxer in the Marine Corps, then a deputy sheriff. (Cheers.) My mom worked as an office assistant. One day they decided to start a security guard business. I thought they were absolutely crazy. We literally had no savings. But they always believed in the American dream. (Cheers, applause.) So my dad worked to grow the business. My mom did the books at night. And at 18 I guarded the parking lot at the Catholic church bingoes. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Now, my dad made sure I could take care of myself. I carried a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum. (Cheers, applause.) Yes, that gun weighed more than I did. (Laughter.)\nMy parents grew that small business from one 18-year-old guarding a bingo to more than 125 employees in three states. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd sure, there was help along the way. But my parents took the risk. They stood up. And you better believe they built it. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy parents also taught me about having the courage to stand for something. So I went to law school and I became a prosecutor. I took on a speciality that very few choose to pursue. I prosecuted child abuse and child homicide cases 鈥斅燾ases that were truly gut-wrenching. But standing up for those kids, being their voice for justice, was the honor of a lifetime. (Cheers, applause.)\nSometimes you pay a price for standing up. When I was a young prosecutor, I got called to testify against my boss. I could have backed down, but I didn't. I stood up to him. And he fired me for it. So I took him on, ran against him for district attorney and beat him by a landslide. (Cheers, applause.)\nI fear some of our leaders today have lost the courage to stand up. That we have now 鈥斅爓hat we have now are politicians. They won't offer real plans, and only stand up when they want to blame someone else. And I don't say that just because a Democrat is in the White House.\nI was a Democrat for many years. So were my parents.\nBefore I ran for district attorney, two Republicans invited my husband and me to lunch, and I knew a party switch was exactly what they wanted. So I told Chuck, we'll be polite, enjoy a free lunch and then say goodbye. But we talked about issues. They never used the words \"Republican\" or \"Democrat,\" \"conservative\" or \"liberal.\" We talked about many issues, like welfare. Is it a way of life or a hand up? Talked about the size of government. How much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car, and I looked over at Chuck and said, I'll be damned; we're Republicans. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis election should not be about political parties. Too many Americans are out of work, and our debt is out of control. This election needs to be about those issues. And it is the responsibility of both parties to offer up real solutions and have an honest debate. In New Mexico, I inherited the largest structural deficit in state history. And our legislature is controlled by Democrats. We don't always agree, but we came together in a bipartisan manner and turned that deficit into a surplus.\n(Cheers, applause.) And we did it without raising taxes. (Cheers, applause.) But that's not the kind of leadership that we are seeing from President Obama. He promised to bring us all together, to cut unemployment, to pass immigration reform in his first year and even promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term. Do you remember that?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!\nSUSANA MARTINEZ: But he hasn't come close. They haven't even passed a budget in Washington, D.C. in three years. (Boos.) If he can take credit for government building small businesses, then he can accept responsibility for breaking his promise and adding $5 trillion to the national debt 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅燽ecause he did build that. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs the first Hispanic female governor in the history, little girls, they often come up to me in the grocery store or in the mall. They look, and they point, and when they get the courage to come up, they ask, are you Susana? And they run up and they give me a hug. And I wonder, how do you know who I am?\nBut they do, and these are little girls.\nIt's in moments like these when I'm reminded that we each pave a path, and for me, it's about paving a path for those little girls to follow. They need to know: No more barriers. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn many ways, Mitt Romney and I are very different 鈥斅燿ifferent starts in life, different paths to leadership, different cultures. But we've each shared in the promise of America. And we share a core belief that the promise of America must be kept for the next generation. \"El sueno americano es tener exito.\" (Cheers, applause.) Is success 鈥斅爄t is success, and success is the American dream. And that success is not something to be ashamed of or to demonize.\nThere is one candidate in this election who will protect that dream, one leader who will fight hard to keep the promise of America for the next generation. And that's why we must stand up and make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Condi!\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you so much. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, distinguished delegates. Good evening, fellow Republicans.\nGood evening, my fellow Americans. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe gather here at a time of significance and challenge. This young century has been a difficult one. I can remember as if it were yesterday when my young assistant came into my office at the White House to say that a plane had hit the World Trade Center, and then a second plane, and then a third plane, the Pentagon. And later we would learn that a plane had crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, driven into the ground by brave souls who died so that others might live. (Cheers, applause.) From that day on 鈥斅爁rom that day on, our sense of vulnerability and our concepts of security were never the same again.\nThen in 2008 the global financial and economic crisis would stun us. And it still reverberates as we deal with unemployment and economic uncertainty and bad policies that cast a pall over an American economy and a recovery that is desperately needed at home and abroad. (Applause.)\nAnd we have seen 鈥斅爓e have seen that the desire for liberty and freedom is indeed universal, as men and women in the Middle East rise up to seize it. Yet the promise of the Arab Spring is engulfed in uncertainty. Internal strife and hostile neighbors are challenging the young, fragile democracy of Iraq. Dictators in Iran and Syria butcher their people and threaten regional security. Russia and China prevent a response. And everyone asks: Where does America stand?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! (Applause.)\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: Indeed 鈥斅爄ndeed, that is the question of the hour. Where does America stand? You see, when friends or foes alike don't know the answer to that question unambiguously and clearly, the world is likely to be a more dangerous and chaotic place.\nSince World War II, the United States has had an answer to that question. We stand for free people and free markets. We will defend and support them. (Cheers, applause.) We will sustain a balance of power that favors freedom.\nNow to be sure, the burdens of leadership have been heavy. I know, as you do, the sacrifice of Americans, especially the sacrifice of many of our bravest in the ultimate sacrifice. But our armed forces are the sure shield and foundation of liberty, and we are so fortunate that we have men and women in uniform who volunteer. They volunteer to defend us at the front lines of freedom, and we owe them our eternal gratitude. (Cheers, applause.)\nI know too that it has not always been easy, though it has been rewarding, to speak for those who would otherwise not have a voice: the religious dissident in China, the democracy advocate in Venezuela, the political prisoner in Iran.\nIt has been hard to muster the resources to support fledgling democracies and to intervene on behalf of the most desperate: the AIDS orphan in Uganda, the refugee fleeing Zimbabwe, the young woman who has been trafficked into the sex trade in Southeast Asia. It has been hard. Yet this assistance, together with the compassionate work of private charities, people of conscience and people of faith, have shown the soul of our country.\nAnd I know, too 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅營 know, too, that there is a weariness. I know that it feels as if we have carried these burdens long enough. But we can only know that there is no choice, because one of two things will happen if we don't lead. Either no one will lead and there will be chaos, or someone will fill the vacuum who does not share our values. My fellow Americans, we do not have a choice. We cannot be reluctant to lead, and you cannot lead from behind. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand this reality. Our well- being at home and our leadership abroad are inextricably linked. They know what to do. They know that our friends and allies must again be able to trust us. From Israel to Colombia, from Poland to the Philippines, our allies and friends have to know that we will be reliable and consistent and determined. And our foes 鈥斅爋ur foes can have no reason to doubt our resolve because peace really does come through strength. (Cheers, applause.)\nOur military capability and our technological advantage will be safe in Mitt Romney's hands. We must work for an open global economy and pursue free and fair trade to grow our exports and our influence abroad.\nIf you are worried about the rise of China, just consider this. The United States has negotiated 鈥斅爐he United States has ratified only three trade agreements in the last few years, and those were negotiated in the Bush administration. (Cheers, applause.) China 鈥斅燙hina has signed 15 free trade agreements and is in the progress (sic; process) of negotiating as many as 18 more. Sadly, we are abandoning the field of free and fair trade, and it will come back to haunt us. (Applause.)\nWe must not allow the chance to attain energy independence to slip from our grasp. We are blessed with a gift of oil and gas resources here in North America, and we must develop them. We can develop them sensitively, we can develop them, securing our environment, but we must develop them. (Cheers, applause.) And we have the ingenuity to develop alternative sources of energy, too.\nBut most importantly, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will rebuild the foundation of our strength, the American economy, stimulating private sector growth and stimulating small-business entrepreneurship.\n(Cheers, applause.) When the world looks at us today, they see an American government that cannot live within its means. They see an American government that continues to borrow money that will mortgage the future of generations to come. The world knows that when a nation loses control of its finances, it eventually loses control of its destiny. That is not the America that has inspired people to follow our lead. (Applause.)\nAfter all, when the world looks to 鈥斅�(audio break) 鈥斅爓e are the most successful economic and political experiment in human history. That is the true basis of American exceptionalism. You see, the essence of America, what really unites us, is not nationality or ethnicity or religion. It is an idea. And what an idea it is, that you can come from humble circumstances and you can do great things, that it does not matter where you came from; it matters where you are going. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy fellow Americans, ours has never been a narrative of grievance and entitlement. We have never believed that I am doing poorly because you are doing well. We have never been jealous of one another and never envious of each other's successes.\n(Cheers, applause.) No, ours has been a belief in opportunity, and it has been a constant struggle, long and hard, up and down, to try to extend the benefits of the American dream to all.\nBut that American ideal is indeed in danger today. There is no country, no, not even a rising China, that can do more harm to us than we can do to ourselves if we do not do the hard work before us here at home. (Cheers, applause.)\nMore than at any other time in history, greatness is built on mobilizing human potential and ambition. We have always done that better than any country in the world. People have come here from all over because they have believed our creed of opportunity and limitless horizons. They have come here from the world's most impoverished nations just to make a decent wage. And they have come here from advanced societies as engineers and scientists to fuel the knowledge- based revolution in the Silicon Valley of California 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅爄n the Research Triangle of North Carolina 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼long Route 128 in Massachusetts, in Austin, Texas, and across this great land. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe must continue to welcome the world's most ambitious people to be a part of us. In that way we stay young and optimistic and determined. We need immigration laws that protect our borders, meet our economic needs and yet show that we are a compassionate nation of immigrants. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe have been successful, too, because Americans have known that one's status of birth is not a permanent condition. Americans have believed that you might not be able to control your circumstances, but you can control your response to your circumstances. (Cheers, applause.) And your greatest ally in controlling your response to your circumstances has been a quality education. (Applause.) But today, today when I can look at your ZIP code and I can tell whether you're going to get a good education, can I honestly say it doesn't matter where you came from; it matters where you're going? The crisis in K-12 education is a threat to the very fabric of who we are. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy mom was a teacher. I respect the profession. We need great teachers, not poor ones and not mediocre ones. We have to have high standards for our kids because self-esteem comes from achievement, not from lax standards and false praise. (Cheers, applause.) And we need to give parents greater choice 鈥斅爌articularly, particularly poor parents, whose kids, very often minorities, are trapped in failing neighborhood schools. (Applause.)\nThis is the civil rights issue of our day. (Cheers, applause.)\nIf we do anything less, we condemn generations to joblessness and hopefulness and life on the government dole. If we do anything less, we will endanger our global imperative for competitiveness. And if we do anything less, we will tear apart the fabric of who we are and cement the turn toward entitlement and grievance.\nMitt Romney 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅燤itt Romney and Paul Ryan will rebuild us at home, and they will help us lead abroad. They will provide an answer to the question, where does America stand?\nThe challenge is real, and the times are hard, but America has met and overcome hard challenges before. Whenever you find yourself doubting us, just think about all those times that America made the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect: our revolutionary founding against the greatest military power of the time; a Civil War, brother against brother, hundreds of thousands dead on both sides, but we emerged a more perfect union; a second founding when impatient patriots were determined to overcome the birth defect of slavery and the scourge of segregation; a long struggle against communism, with the Soviet Union eventually in collapse and Europe whole, free and at peace; and in the aftermath of 9/11, the willingness to take really hard, hard decisions that secured us and prevented the follow-on attack that everybody thought preordained.\nAnd on a personal note 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼nd on a personal note, a little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham, the segregated city of the South where her parents can't take her to a movie theater or to a restaurant, but they have her absolutely convinced that even if she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter, she could be president of the United States if she wanted to be, and she becomes the secretary of state. (Cheers, applause.)\nYes, America has a way of making the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect. But we know it was never inevitable. It took leadership, and it took courage, and it took belief in our values. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have the integrity and the experience and the vision to lead us. They know who we are. They know who we want to be. They know who we are in the world and what we offer.\nThat is why 鈥斅爐hat is why this is a moment and an election of consequence, because it just has to be that the freest and most compassionate country on the face of the earth will continue to be the most powerful and a beacon for prosperity and liberty across the world.\nGod bless you, and God bless this extraordinary country, this exceptional country, the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nMIKE HUCKABEE: Thank you. Thank you very much. I was so very honored to be asked to address one of this week's themes: We can do better. And then I was backstage and I heard some folks say that after hearing me speak, the delegates are going to say: We sure can do better than Huckabee. (Laughter.) And that's when they will unanimously nominate Mitt Romney to be the next president of the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nI want to say that Tampa has been a wonderful and hospitable city, and I'm grateful for all that they've done for us. But the only hitch in an otherwise perfect week was the awful noise coming from the hotel room next door to mine. Turns out, it was just Debbie Wasserman Schultz practicing her speech for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte next week, bless her heart.\n(Mixed cheers and boos, applause.)\nFour years ago Mitt Romney and I were opponents. We still are. (Chuckles.) But we're not opposing each other. No, we are mutual opponents of the miserably failed experiments that have put this country in a downward spiral. The United States of America was originally an experiment. But it was an experiment in recognizing God-given individual liberty and creating a government in which no one is deemed better than another and in which all of us are equal, not equal in abilities but equal in intrinsic worth and value. It is the essence not just of who we are but what we are.\nNow, let me just say, to those who question how once-rivals can be now united, it's quite simple. We have Barack Obama to thank. (Cheers, applause.) It was Barack Obama who said, you didn't build it. Translation: It doesn't belong to you. (Cheers, applause.) Well, no small differences among us in our party approximate the vast differences between the liberty-limiting, radical left-wing, anti- business, reckless-spending, tax-hiking party of Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi versus an energized America who knows we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nFor four years we've given a chance to a man with very limited experience in governing, no experience in business whatsoever and, since taking office, mostly in 鈥斅爄nterested in campaigning, blaming and aiming excuses at his predecessor, the Republicans and people in business or, as Republicans like to call them, employers.\nWe've stagnated into an economy that has taken all that hope right down the slope and left millions without jobs, forced out of their homes by foreclosure, herded into dependency upon a government that promises us candy but gives us cavities.\nBarack Obama seems intent on enrolling more people on food stamps. Mitt Romney's focus is going to be on generating more jobs that will make food stamps unnecessary for them. (Cheers, applause.) We know full well we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney turned around companies that were on the skids. He turned around a scandal-ridden Olympics that was deep in the red, into high point of profit and patriotic pride. And he turned around a very liberal state when he erased a deficit and replaced it with a surplus.\nDo you remember when Barack Obama said that if couldn't turn things around in three years, it would be a one-term proposition? (Cheers, applause.) Well, it's been almost four years. I say let's make him a proposition he can't refuse. Let's vote him out. (Cheers, applause.)\nI understand that the job of president is admittedly tougher than running a company, an Olympic contest or a commonwealth. But when one sees what even Bill Clinton noted was a sterling record of problem- solving that has marked the life of Mitt Romney, we are confident that we will do better.\n(Cheers, applause.) I am thrilled to say Mitt Romney has been loyal to his lovely wife, who knocked it out of the park last night in this arena. (Cheers, applause.) He 鈥斅爃e's been loyal to his sons, to his country, to his employees and to his church.\nWell, I'm sure now that the press is going to tell you he isn't perfect. But my friends, for the past four years, we tried the one that the press thought was perfect, and that hasn't worked out all that well for us. (Cheers, applause.) That's why tonight I tell you 鈥斅�(chuckles) 鈥斅爓e can do better.\nOur Founding Fathers left taxation and tyranny, seeking religious liberty and a society of meritocracy rather than aristocracy. What they created was a bold experiment in government, believing that God gave us unalienable rights and that the role of government is simply to make sure that those rights are protected.\nSo fearful were they that the government would grow beyond their intention that even after crafting our magnificent Constitution, they said, we can do even better. They added amendments. We call them the Bill of Rights. Those Bill of Rights limit what the government can do, and they guarantee what we the people have the unimpeded right to do, whether to speak, assemble, worship, pray, publish or even refuse intrusions into our homes.\nMany of those founders died to pass on that heritage. They had lived under the boot of big government. And what they said was: We can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs a kid growing up in a household, my dad never finished high school. I grew up in a family in which no male upstream from me had ever finished high school, much less gone to college. But I was taught that even though there was nothing I could do about what was behind me, I could change everything about what was in front of me.\nMy working-poor parents told me that I could do better. They taught me I was as good as anybody else. And it never occurred to them to tell me that I could just rest comfortably and wait for good old \"Uncle Sugar\" to feed me, lead me and then bleed me. (Cheers, applause.) They told me to get off my backside, work hard, take risks and treat people honestly and honorably.\nAnd look at me today. I've become, as the press like to label me, a failed candidate. Oh, it's true. I have fallen from the high perch of politics and now I wallow in the mud of the media. (Soft laughter.) But I still know that as a country, we can do better. And with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, we will do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nI want to clear the air about something that has been said. People wonder whether guys like me, an evangelical, would only support a fellow evangelical. Well, my friends, I want to tell you something. Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb, even beyond the womb, and he tells people of faith that they have to bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care.\nFriends, I know we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nLet me say it as clearly as possible that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. (Cheers, applause.) The Democrats have brought back that old dance, the limbo, to see how low they can go in attempting to limit our ability to practice our faith. But this isn't a battle about contraceptives and Catholics but about conscience and the Creator.\nLet me say to you tonight I care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country. (Cheers, applause.)\nJoe Biden 鈥斅燡oe Biden said, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value. Well, in the Senate, Joe's party hasn't produced a budget in three years. What does that say 鈥斅�(chuckles) 鈥斅燼bout their values?\nAnd by the way, speaking of budgets, Joe Biden's budget shows that while he wants to be very generous with your money through higher taxes and government spending, for years he gave less than two-tenths of 1 percent of his own money to charity.\nHe just wants you to give the government more so he and the Democrats can feel better about themselves. Mitt Romney has given over 16 percent of his income to church and charity. (Cheers, applause.) And my friends, I feel a lot better about having a president who will give generously of his own money instead of mine or yours. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy concern is not Barack Obama's past, but my concern is for the future 鈥斅爊ot his future, but for the future of my grandchildren, little Chandler and Scarlett. And under this president, we have burdened each of them with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and a system that will collapse upon itself because he thinks that we can prosper by punishing productivity and rewarding reckless irresponsibility.\nThe Democrats say we ought to give Barack Obama credit for trying. Folks, that sounds like the nonsense of giving every kid a trophy for showing up. (Cheers, applause.) Let's be clear: We're talking about leading the country, not playing on a third-grade soccer team. Look, I realize this is a man who got a Nobel Peace Prize for what he would potentially do. But in the real world, you get the prize for producing something, not just promising something. (Cheers, applause.) Sometimes we get so close to the picture we really can't see it clearly.\nI've had the privilege of working with Bono for the past few years in the ONE campaign to fight AIDS and hunger and disease around the world.\nBono is an Irishman and a great humanitarian, and I remember him telling me of his admiration for America. He said, America is more than just a country. We are an idea. And he reminded me that we are an exceptional nation with an extraordinary history who owes it to the generations who are coming after us to leave them with an extraordinary legacy. But if we don't change the direction of our nation now, our bequest will be nothing but an extraordinary chain. But dear friends, we can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama is out of gas, and Americans are out of patience. And our great republic is almost out of time. It's time that we no longer lead from behind, but that we get off our behinds and leave something lasting for those who came after us instead of a mountain of debt and a pile of excuses. Tonight 鈥斅爊ot because we're Republicans 鈥斅爄t's because we are Americans that we proudly stand with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and we say, we will do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nGod bless you. Thank you. God bless. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nTIM PAWLENTY: Thank you. Thank you very much. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Barack Obama's retirement party. (Cheers, applause.)\nFour years ago we came together for this convention back in my home state of Minnesota. (Cheers, applause.) And a lot's happened since then. We've had four years of Barack Obama in the White House. Ah, the Obama White House. One bad decision follows another.\nIt's hard to say exactly just what his worst mistake has been. There's so many to choose from: the stimulus, his energy policy, \"Obamacare,\" taxes, Joe Biden. (Laughter.)\nNow, I hear Joe's particularly interested in tonight's proceedings. He even thought about coming here to Tampa, and he's taking notes, because when Paul Ryan speaks, Joe will finally get to hear what a real vice president sounds like. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut you know, President Obama isn't as bad as people say. He's actually worse. (Laughter, applause.) The president takes more vacations than that guy on the Bizarre Foods show. (Laughter.) And I'll give Barack Obama credit for creating jobs these last four years 鈥斅爁or golf caddies. (Laughter.) Actually, Barack Obama is the first president to create more excuses than jobs. (Applause.) In his view, it's George's fault; it's the bank's fault; it's Europe's fault; it's the weather's fault; it's Congress' fault. Mr. President, if you want to find fault, I suggest you look in the mirror. (Cheers, applause.)\nI've come to realize that Barack Obama is the \"tattoo president.\" Like a big tattoo, it seemed cool when we were young, but later on that decision doesn't look so good. And you wonder: What was I thinking? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) But the worst part is, you're going to have to explain it to your kids. (Laughter.)\nNext week Barack Obama will plead with America to give his failed policies and ideas another chance. He's asking Americans to give him more time and more money. Well, sorry, Mr. President, but you're out of time, and we're out of money. (Cheers, applause.)\nBarack Obama's failed us. But look, it's understandable. A lot of people fail at their first job. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nNow, our opponents claim to be the party of the middle class, but Democrats don't understand this fundamental point: It's really hard for people to be part of the middle class if they don't have a job.\nNow, I know a bit about these things.\nI grew up in a meatpacking town. For much of his life, my dad was a truck driver. My mom was a homemaker. She died when I was 16 years old, and my dad lost his job not long after that. I was the only one of five kids in our family who had a chance to go to college.\nWhen I traveled the country these past few years, I met Americans from all different walks of life. If you ask middle-class Americans about their hopes and their dreams, they'll share their heart but also their concerns. Can they pay the mortgage? Will they have enough money to buy groceries or put gas in the car? Will they be able to get their kids into college or pay the tuition?\nBut jobs don't come from politicians. They come from the entrepreneurs, the inventors, the innovators and the risk-takers. (Cheers, applause.) America's entrepreneurs know taxes are too high and regulations are too costly and complex. \"Obamacare\" frightens them, and they want more American energy. And they're collectively making one common plea. They're saying, I want to grow my business and employ people, but they're also saying this: Just get the government off my back. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need to let them know that help's on the way. And help's name is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, we have the best candidate. This isn't his first job or the first time he's been a leader who's produced results. He's made a success of failing companies. He made a success of the Olympics. He even made government in Massachusetts more effective and efficient. And now he's ready to help get America back on track and Americans back to work. (Cheers, applause.) He has a plan to strengthen and grow America's middle class with lower taxes, a government that works for the American people instead of dashing their hopes and dreams, lowering energy prices and greater access to quality education for all.\nBut there's one other thing that I want to leave you with tonight. It's important for America to know that Mitt Romney is not only a great leader; he's also a remarkable person. (Cheers, applause.) He's smart, gracious and wise. And he has this infectious good cheer about him, something I appreciate and something America needs. Mitt Romney never quits moving. When he sees a problem, he goes after it and finds the solution. It's that can-do spirit, combined with a lifetime of service and success, that convinced me to support him. And it's that can-do spirit that we need in the White House leading America now. (Applause.)\nAs a former governor, I know that leadership takes optimism, but not blind optimism. We need a leader who understands the depth of our challenges but who also doesn't shy away from them.\nMitt Romney knows what our problems are, and he has the tools and the experience and the energy and the right policies to fix them. (Cheers, applause.)\nAfter four years of this president, we need Mitt Romney now more than ever. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm proud to be supporting him for president of the United States, and I know you are too. And with any luck, in a few months, Barack Obama will at last get some experience in the private sector. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Good night. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: Thank you. Thank you very much. Buenas noches, Puerto Rico. (Cheers, applause.) Buenas noches, Florida. Buenas noches, America.\nAs a proud American serving the nearly 4 million American citizens of Puerto Rico, I'm honored to be with you tonight. We gather to celebrate the hopes and dreams of every American. We all believe in the greatness of this nation. And this greatness lies within each of us.\nHardworking Americans are fighting every day to provide for themselves and their families and leave a more prosperous country for the next generation. That is true here in Florida, it is true in Puerto Rico, and it is true throughout this great land of ours.\nBut as families have tightened their budgets, Washington continues its wasteful spending.\nUnless we elect leaders who take responsibility now, our children and theirs will pay for it later. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou and I know there is a better way, and like many conservative governors around the country, we are proving it. When I took office, I inherited a $3.3 billion budget deficit, per person the largest anywhere in this nation. We could not even meet our payroll. We were on the brink of bankruptcy.\nBut we did not shy away from our responsibility to lead. We cut government expenses by almost 20 percent, starting with my own salary. We reduced our deficit 90 percent while continuing to invest in our schools, hospitals and highways. At the same time, we slashed taxes 50 percent on individuals and 30 percent on businesses, the largest tax cut in Puerto Rico history. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd guess what? Our private sector, the real economy, began to create jobs again. Imagine if we had national policies that support rather than prevent growth. We'd then be able to truly unleash the engine of prosperity that our country and our people deserve. That's what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will do for America. (Cheers, applause.) They understand that each community's challenges are unique, but the answers are the same.\nOur families cannot grow their budgets if politicians keep growing Washington's budget. We need to get government out of our way. (Cheers, applause.) And we need to let freedom and the spirit of the American people shine through. We can outthink, out-dream, out-work and outproduce anybody in the world.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!\nLUIS FORTUNO: I know it, you know it, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan certainly know it. (Cheers, applause.) They have a plan and a vision that places our faith in you, the American people, not in Washington. (Cheers, applause.) Ask any small-business owner in America today, from the dairy farmer in Appleton, Wisconsin, to the bodega owner in Kissimmee, Florida. They want to grow, to produce and to hire. But they are concerned, worried that Washington will continue to punish them with more taxes, more red tape and more government control. Give them the freedom to grow, and you'll see how many jobs they create. (Cheers, applause.)\nI like to talk a lot about freedom because freedom is the essence of who we are as Americans. Over 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in uniform 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐o defend our nation and the freedom we hold so dear. Like in your home states, we raise and salute the American flag. Just like our fellow citizens in Florida or Virginia, we share the same undying spirit that all Americans have.\nAllow me to share an example of that spirit. I visited a soldier from Puerto Rico at Walter Reed Army Medical Center several years ago. This young man had bravely served in combat and was given little chance to live. Without knowing if he could hear me, in every visit I would whisper into his ear. I would tell him how proud and thankful we were for his dedication and sacrifice, adding, \"No te rindas,\" \"Don't give up.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nMonths later, after his miraculous recovery, I had the honor of awarding the Purple Heart. He never gave up. (Cheers, applause.)\nFor him and for every American in uniform, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: For every mother who struggles, saves and sacrifices so her children will have greater opportunities, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.) (Applause.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: For every small-business owner who builds it to make a better life, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.) (Applause.)\nLUIS FORTUNO: For Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, who know what it takes to put America back to work and back on track, we will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible) 鈥斅爑p.\nLUIS FORTUNO: And for the values 鈥斅爐he values that make America great, the justice that is our right, the freedom to unleash the greatness within each of us and the liberty that God endowed every American 鈥斅爁or that, I will never give up.\nYou will never give up. We will never give up.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: We will never give up!\nLUIS FORTUNO: God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.) Muchas gracias, Puerto Rico. See you tomorrow! Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nSTEVE COHEN: Good evening. My name is Steven Cohen, and I am president of Screen Machine Industries, a family-owned manufacturer of construction and mining equipment located in the great Buckeye State of Ohio. (Cheers, applause.) And yes, we did build this company. (Cheers, applause.) Our country's nearly 30 million small businesses serve as the American backbone for job creation and product innovation. The opportunity to create new products and open new markets is the American dream. This capitalistic spirit has supported our economy since its founding.\nAs a manufacturer, our products are the heartbeats of our business. We can't tolerate other companies stealing hard work without compensation. It can take several years and tens of thousands of dollars to achieve patent status. Once granted, we expect it to be protected.\nOur products are often stolen and copied overseas for a mere fraction of the price. All too often tariffs and unfair trade practices make it difficult for American businesses to export. We need a president that will protect America's patented inventions, guard the value of our currency and open up new markets for American products. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerican small businesses face a mountain of regulations and taxes. In addition, our international competitors do not have to face the upcoming costs associated with funding a multi-billion-dollar health care plan, overreaching emissions standards and the unnecessary war on coal. These factors create a tremendous disadvantage in the global marketplace. We need an administration that will lessen tax burdens and government regulations that strangle small businesses.\nWhile we face higher government-imposed costs, cheaper imports from overseas companies flood our markets. Unnecessary regulations and mandates imposed on business make our products more expensive to make and less competitive to sell. We need a Romney administration to ensure our country's competitiveness and give our companies the opportunities to expand and hire again. (Cheers, applause.) Let's bring back that original American will to invent, employ and prosper! Thank you.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nMS. : Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Yohana de la Torre live from backstage in the Republican National Convention. And today I have the honor to be with Michigan delegate Michelle Voorheis. Welcome, Michelle. (Cheers.)\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Hi, Yohana. It's great to be here tonight.\nMS. : Michelle, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Well, I'm a wife and a mom, and I come from the small town of Clio, Michigan. (Cheers, applause.) And I'm a small- business owner.\nMS. : I understand that you have a commercial real estate business. How has your business fared under President Obama?'\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Well, first let me say that Obama did not build my business. (Cheers, applause.) But he is doing everything in his power to tear it down. Under his administration, the regulations and restrictions that he is placing on the banks have caused them to stop lending money. So even though my husband and I have excellent credit and we've never missed a payment, we're unsure whether we're going to be able to get the financing to continue funding our business.\nThis creates uncertainty for us, so we aren't hiring any employees. This makes for 12- to 14-hour days that we have to work to keep our business running. I have an 18-year-old son that I just sent off to college and a 90-year-old mother-in-law that we are caring for, and I don't see any end in sight if something doesn't change soon.\nMS. : What does your future look like for you?\nMICHELLE VOORHEIS: Well, first I want to say that we give thanks to God for everything that we have. My husband and I have been married for 35 years, and during that time, we have worked hard, we've played by the rules, we've done everything right. So we thought at the end of the day we were going to have a great retirement and we were going to have a successful business that we could leave to our kids. But right now, I don't know if I'm ever going to get to retire. I'm 55. I don't want to start over again and do something else. So under the Obama administration, I feel that our dreams are slipping away.\nMS. : Michelle's story is just one of the many of small- business owners and what they're going through today during the President Obama's administration.\nNow we go back live to the Republican National Convention. I'm Yohana de la Torre. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nROB PORTMAN: Thank you. Thank you. (Chuckles.) Thank you. Good evening, America! (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd hello to the fired-up delegation from the Buckeye State right there in front of me. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy name is Rob Portman, and they say I was on Governor Romney's short list of vice presidential candidates. Apparently, it wasn't short enough. (Scattered laughter.) What a great convention. And I'm delighted to be here tonight to talk about the fundamental differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama when it comes to understanding our economy.\nLet's begin by talking about something the Democrats love to demonize: Mitt Romney's success in the private sector. He built a company from the ground up, created lots of jobs, and yes, he made money. (Cheers, applause.) He made it the old-fashioned way, folks: He earned it. (Cheers, applause.)\nThen you have Barack Obama, who never started a business, never even worked in business, and yet he claims those who have should give credit to the government or someone else for their success. (Boos.)\nSo you have one candidate who understands that success comes from working hard, competing and taking risks. And you have another candidate who believes that success comes from government. (Boos.) Let me ask you this: Which one do you think knows how to turn around this economy? (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Romney! Romney!\nROB PORTMAN: Right answer. Let me ask you this: Which one would you choose to invest your life savings?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!\nROB PORTMAN: Should it be any different for safeguarding our nation's economy?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nROB PORTMAN: Or let's say you don't have any savings. Let's say you're worried about how to pay September's rent or mortgage. Let's say you're one of the millions of Americans out of work or millions more who have given up looking for work. You've got to be running out of patience and hope. You've got to be tired, looking for a new start. Well, you don't have to be patient any longer. Through your vote this fall, you can change the leadership of this country and the opportunities for you and your families. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica, it's been nearly four years of 8 percent unemployment 鈥斅燿ouble-digit unemployment for young people, Hispanics, African Americans. Four years. FDR and Truman won an entire world war in four years. America is tired of waiting. (Cheers, applause.) Listen, in business if you don't move rapidly, what happens? You're out of business; you're finished. We want a president who operates at business speed, not government speed. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama says that he deserves re-election because his economic policies have worked. Not in this universe, they haven't. (Cheers, boos, applause.) In fact, the experts tell us that if we don't change our policies, we're going back into recession next year. Folks, tens of millions of Americans are not out of the last recession. Governor Romney had a plan to build his business.\nHe now has a detailed plan to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class. (Cheers, applause.) I ask you, where's the president's economic plan? Blaming others does not qualify as a plan.\nNow, the president did submit a budget. It was so bad, folks, that not a 鈥斅�(audio break) 鈥斅燫epublican or a single Democrat in the entire United States Congress would vote for it. He got zero votes. That is a failure of leadership. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama has been right about at least one prediction he's made about the economy. He said: If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition. (Cheers, applause.)\nI think you're right about that, Mr. President. It hasn't worked because you cannot spend your way, regulate your way, tax your way or blame your way out of the economic mess that we're in. (Cheers, applause.) You have to liberate the productive power of the American people through policies that encourage innovation, risk-taking, investment and jobs. And you have to compete and win in the global economy. Governor Romney understands this. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn contrast, President Obama is the first president in 75 years 鈥斅燚emocrat or Republican 鈥斅爓ho hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas.\nNow why is this important? Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of our borders, and to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhile this administration has been dragging its feet, other countries have been busy negotiating hundreds of new trade agreements to benefit their workers, their farmers, taking away our opportunities. President Obama has been so driven to advance his big- government ideology that he has abandoned the daily work that a government must do to open markets, restore business confidence and create the climate for job growth. This is the work President Romney would begin on day one. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) (Inaudible.)\nROB PORTMAN: Take trade with China. China manipulates its currency, giving it an unfair trade advantage. So why doesn't the president do something about it? I'll tell you one reason. President Obama could not run up his record trillion-dollar deficit if the Chinese didn't buy our bonds to finance them. Folks, we are as beholden to China for bonds as we are to the Middle East for oil. This will end under Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need to knock down these barriers to trade abroad, but we also need to knock down self-imposed barriers to success right here at home. We need to reform our outdated and complicated tax code. We need to fix our burdensome regulatory system. And we need an energy policy that encourages the development of our resources right here, in the ground, in America.\n(Cheers, applause.) America has a choice between Mitt Romney, who seeks to grow the economy, and Barack Obama, who seeks to redistribute it. Which one do you think will liberate America's entrepreneurial spirit?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!\nROB PORTMAN: At the other party's convention, you're going to hear another chant. Their chant will be, \"Four more years, four more years.\" Folks, we cannot afford four more years. (Cheers, applause.) How about no more years? (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years! No more years!\nROB PORTMAN: Governor Romney 鈥斅燝overnor Romney chose a terrific partner in Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. (Cheers, applause.) Paul's a close friend, a great family man, and he's got a reformer's heart.\nContrast this to Joe Biden. Vice President Biden has told people out of work to, quote, just hang in there. So much for hope and change. Paul Ryan is not asking America to continue to hang in there. He's proposing new policies that will give poor and middle-class families opportunities and hope for the future. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney made his mark turning around businesses, solving problems. Paul Ryan made his mark as a respected reformer focused on results.\nTogether, they will do what President Obama has not done: They will lead in breaking through the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. (Cheers, applause.) America, give them the chance to restore America's economy and restore the American dream.\nI've seen that dream up close. When I was a kid, my dad left his job as a salesman for a big company and started his own business, taking a risk. He sold forklift trucks. My mom was the bookkeeper. She had to borrow money 鈥斅爐hey had to borrow money from her uncle because the bank wouldn't give him a loan. He lost money the first few years, but he never lost his dream. By the time he retired and my brother took over, the business had 200 employees. Two hundred families in southwest Ohio were supported by that business.\nThis is the classic American story not of government telling us what to do but of free men and free women willing to work hard and take a risk to build something of value for themselves, their families and their community. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nROB PORTMAN: About a year into the Obama administration, I asked my dad whether he would do it again. He said, Rob, with all the uncertainty out there today, I don't know if I would take the risk. In that one sentence, folks, he summed up what I've heard from hundreds of small-business owners all across Ohio and around this great country. They're afraid to make the investment, and jobs are the casualty. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, we need new leadership and new policies to bring back the dream and renew America's promise. (Cheers, applause.)\nNo more excuses, no more blaming others, no more waiting. We need Romney-Ryan, and we need them now. (Cheers, applause.) And with your help, it's going to happen. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless our great country. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nTAD TRUE: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, energy powers everything we do, and America depends on reliable and affordable energy. This is a simple concept, but the Obama administration does not get it. His policies are driving us away from energy independence, not towards it.\nMitt Romney knows that we need an all-of-the-above energy policy that includes oil, gas and coal and renewables like wind and solar so that we can finally secure energy independence for our country. Infrastructure is fundamental to all energy systems, and infrastructure is critical to achieving energy independence, infrastructure like pipelines, which prompts me to ask, Mr. President, where is the Keystone pipeline? (Cheers, applause.)\nI am part of the third generation of a family-owned businesses, and we operate pipelines in the great states of Wyoming, North Dakota and Montana.\nThese companies were started by my grandfather and then run by my father and uncles. Between them and our 152 dedicated and incredibly talented employees, we built almost 4,000 miles of pipeline. (Cheers, applause.) A lot of our recent work has been constructing new pipeline infrastructure in western North Dakota to support the development of the Bakken oil shale, an exciting and an important development for America.\nSome time ago we agreed to build the on ramp the Keystone XL pipeline, so that it could take American-produced oil to American markets. (Cheers.) If Keystone had received timely approval of their permit, it would be under construction today. Instead Americans have missed out on jobs from this pipeline because the Obama administration has played politics with the Keystone project.\nMy hope is that my three boys, Henry, Sam and Charlie, will be part of the fourth generation of our family business. (Cheers.) And although my kids think pipelines are boring, I know and you know and Mitt Romney knows that pipelines are vital to America's energy system. (Cheers, applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, this is not about just one pipeline. This is about a fundamental transformation of America's energy system so that we can achieve that long sought-after goal of energy independence. (Applause.)\nMore importantly, it's about my three boys and your children and about rebuilding a nation that can once again power itself.\n(Cheers, applause.) We need a president that understands that we need all of that energy, all of that oil, all of those jobs. And we need a president that understands that America needs that pipeline. That president is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
    "MS. : Good evening, conventiongoers. I'm Tara Wald (ph) live for the 2012 Republican National Convention here on the convention floor, and with me is Yash Wadhwa, your civil engineer from India. Tell us a little bit about why you came and you immigrated to this country. Give us a little snapshot.\nYASH WADHWA: Let me first say one thing: I'm a proud Republican from the state of Wisconsin! (Cheers, applause.)\nMS. : All right, good old Paul Ryan country.\nYASH WADHWA: The next vice president of the United States. I came to this country as a student with few dollars in my pocket and a dream in my heart. I knew America was a country which provided opportunities for any person from anywhere in the world and live the American dream. Guess what, I have lived the American dream. (Cheers, applause.)\nMS. : All right.\nYASH WADHWA: And I'm very proud of it. This is the best country on earth, and I love it with passion. In 1980 something happened which changed my life: A man by the name of Ronald Reagan was elected the president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) And he inspired me so much that I decided to become a U.S. citizen and a Republican.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nMS. : All right. Well, tell me this. You owned a small business for 22 years. So in your opinion, what are the biggest challenges that small-business owners face today?\nYASH WADHWA: Well, let me go back to Ronald Reagan a little bit. Ronald Reagan used to say that America is a shining city on a hill. Under President Obama, we are becoming a tent city with people waiting in line for government handouts, and I don't like it.\nMS. : All right. (Cheers, applause.) Well, we want to thank Yash Wadhwa for joining us from Wisconsin 鈥斅爂reat state. And we want to turn it back to the program. Once again, I'm Tara Wald (ph), live from the 2012 Republican National Convention. (Cheers, applause.) Back to the program.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nSAM OLENS: As attorneys general, we have been on the front line defending the Constitution and the American people from a president driven to exercise government power over our freedoms, our rights and our lives. We know that the Constitution limits federal power, but President Obama clearly believes those limits just get in his way. So he ignores them time and again.\nHe promises to rescue our economy and environment by investing in green jobs but instead funnels your tax dollars into campaign donors' pockets. He promised to have the most transparent administration in history but now refuses to come clean with Congress and the American people about Fast and Furious.\nPAM BONDI: He sure does. He talks about giving us more control over health care decisions but instead grants that power to government bureaucrats. He claims that government is responsible for private-sector success, but the only thing he is building is bigger government. And \"Obamacare\" is exhibit A. (Cheers, applause.)\nSAM OLENS: It distorts our Constitution and endangers our fragile economy. We did everything in our power to stop it, taking the fight all the way to the United States Supreme Court. We prevailed on our two main arguments.\nPAM BONDI: The court agreed that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not allow the federal government to purchase a product 鈥斅爐o force you to purchase something that you do not want.\nThe court agreed that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force states to adopt a budget-busting expansion of Medicaid.\nSAM OLENS: Then came the shocker: The Supreme Court upheld the individual insurance mandate by calling it something the president swore it never was: a tax. At every stage of the process, President Obama and congressional Democrats promised us that the mandate was not a tax because they knew Americans were hurting, and the last thing we needed was another tax, because they knew if the American public were told that \"Obamacare\" was just a massive tax hike, they wouldn't have a prayer of passing it.\nPAM BONDI: Right. Instead, President Obama and the Democrats called it a mandate. Then they turned around and, without a shred of shame, asked the court to call the mandate a tax. Yet the president can't bring himself to acknowledge publicly that the only reason this unaffordable care act still stands is because it is a tax.\nThis is what happens when a president has such total disregard for our individual liberty that he knowingly and purposely imposes unwarranted restrictions against the will of the people. This is not why our Founding Fathers risked their lives and their fortunes when they created a nation. This is not why young American men and women today risk their lives in defense of freedom.\nSo tonight we ask you: Do you want skyrocketing health insurance premiums?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nSAM OLENS: Do you want enormous new financial burdens on young people, who already shoulder our nation's crushing debt?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nPAM BONDI: Do you want the government to force individuals and religious institutions to violate the tenets of their faith?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nSAM OLENS: Do you want over $1 trillion in new tax increases?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nPAM BONDI: Do you want a job-destroying insurance mandate that strangles our businesses?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nSAM OLENS: Do you 鈥斅燿o you want a federal government that tells you what to do, what to think or what to buy when it comes to your health care?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nPAM BONDI: Do you want the federal government to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to hide the true cost of \"Obamacare\"?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nSAM OLENS: Do you want more of this for four more years?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nSAM OLENS: The health care lawsuit has reminded all of us that the Constitution limits the power of government. It has reminded us of the precious relationship between federalism and individual liberty. And though we fundamentally disagree with his decision, Chief Justice Roberts did observe that it is not the Supreme Court's job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\nPAM BONDI: That's right. It is our job to make a new choice. (Cheers.) It is time to stand up and say, in a loud, clear voice, enough!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Enough! (Cheers, applause.)\nPAM BONDI: It is time to repeal \"Obamacare.\" (Cheers, applause.) It is time to stop those who ignore the Constitution when it's expedient.\nIt is time to remember that our rights are not a gift from government, but from God, and that by his grace, we will defend them. It is time for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nThank you.\nSAM OLENS: Thank you.\nPAM BONDI: Have a great night. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nJOHN THUNE: Thank you. Thank you, South Dakota, and good evening, my fellow Republicans.\nIt's no secret that I'm a sports fan. In fact, I get asked all the time if I've ever played basketball with President Obama. The answer is no. I'm still waiting for that invitation.\nThe next question is, do you think you could take him one-on-one. And I say: I really don't know. I've never seen him play. But I can tell you this: President Obama would be easy to defend because you know he's always going to go to his left. (Cheers, applause.)\nLike many Americans, I've been blessed by the hard work and sacrifice of those who've come before. You see, it was back in 1906 that two Norwegian brothers named Nicolai and Matthew Gjeslvik came to this country in search of the American dream.\nWhen they reached the shores of America, the only English words they knew were the words \"apple pie\" and \"coffee,\" which, evidently, they had plenty of on the way over.\nThe immigration officials at Ellis Island determined that their name, Gjelsvik, which was spelled G-J-E-L-S-V-I-K, was too difficult to spell and pronounce, so they asked them to change it. The two brothers picked the name of the farm where they worked in Norway, which was called the Thune Farm. And so Nicolai Gjelsvik became Nick Thune, my grandfather.\nWith their new country 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅爓ith their new country and their new name, the two brothers began their new life by working on the railroad. They learned English and saved enough money to start a small hardware store. And yes, Mr. President, they did build it. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy grandfather raised three sons. The middle son, my father, joined the Navy when World War II broke out. He became a naval aviator, flying combat missions off the aircraft carrier Intrepid in the Pacific theater. On one mission, he shot down four enemy aircraft, for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war, my dad quietly returned to South Dakota, to his hardware store and his family.\nYou know, many versions of that story are told all across this country. The details may be different, but the dream is the same. (Cheers, applause.)\nI hate to say it, but that dream is in serious jeopardy.\nWe have a sluggish economy burdened by Obama administration policies that are weighing down our job creators. Middle-class Americans in cities and on our farms are bearing the brunt. The big-government bureaucrats of the Obama administration have set their sights on our way of life. Instead of preserving family farms and ranches, President Obama's policies are effectively regulating them out of business. His administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores. (Boos.)\nSince President Obama took office, we've had 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent, the longest streak on record. The cost of family health insurance premiums has risen by nearly 19 percent. College tuition has increased by 25 percent. And fuel costs have doubled. The number of people on food stamps has increased by 45 percent. And the debt that we are piling on the backs of our children and grandchildren has gone up by 50 percent. Yet for all of President Obama's talk about the middle class, middle-class incomes are down.\nFolks, we won't be in this situation with Mitt Romney in the White House. He understands 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅爃e understands what it takes for businesses large and small to grow and to create jobs. This knowledge doesn't come from a textbook, although he's read plenty of those. It comes from decades of rolling up his sleeves and getting the job done. (Applause.) It comes from recognizing the strengths and contributions of every individual.\nHis experience tells him that the most valuable insight can be gained not by lecturing, but by listening.\nAnd when he does use his presidential bully pulpit, it will be to champion the cause of small business and make it clear to all companies that it is safe to hire again. (Cheers, applause.)\nOn day one of Mitt Romney's presidency, the transformation of Washington will begin. Gone will be the arrogance of a president whose first instinct is to condemn achievement. Gone will be the attitude that government knows best and solves all. What you will see and hear is a president who will do everything in his power to make sure government is a catalyst for growth, not an obstacle to success. (Cheers, applause.) And you will have a president with a plan to strengthen the middle class.\nMy friends, may it never be said of us that when confronted with the economic peril before us, that we averted our eyes, turned away and did nothing. Our children's future depends on our willingness to act and our decision to elect Mitt Romney president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. May God continue to bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nJOHN MCCAIN: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Audience members singing.) (Chuckles.) (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. It's an honor, as always, my fellow Republicans, to join you at our national convention and add my voice to yours as we nominate the next president of the United States, my friend Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, I had 鈥斅營 had hopes once of addressing you under different circumstances. (Chuckles, laughter.) But our fellow Americans had another plan four years ago, and I accept their decision. I've been blessed for so long to play a role in our nation's affairs, and I'm conscious only of the debt I owe America. And I thank you for the honor. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen we nominate Mitt Romney, we do so with a greater purpose than winning an advantage for our party. We charge him with the care of a higher cause. His election represents the best hopes for our country and the world. It is said that this election will turn on domestic and economic issues. But what Mitt Romney knows and what we know is that the success at home also depends on our leadership in the world. It is our willingness to shape world events for the better that has kept us safe, increased our prosperity, preserved our liberty and transformed human history.\nAt our best, America has led. We have led by our example as a shining city on a hill. We have led at the direction of patriots from both parties. We have led shoulder to shoulder with steadfast friends and allies. We have led by giving voice to the voiceless, insisting that every human life has dignity and aiding those brave souls who risked everything to secure the inalienable rights that are endowed to all by our Creator. We have 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爓e have led with generous hearts, moved by an abiding love of justice, to help others eradicate disease, lift themselves from poverty, live under laws of their own making and determine their own destinies. We have led, when necessary, with the armed might of freedom's defenders. And always we have led from the front, never from behind. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis is what makes America an exceptional nation. It's not just a matter of who we are; it's the record of what we have done. It is the responsibility that generation after generations of Americans has affirmed and carried forward. It is a cause that many Americans have sacrificed everything, absolutely everything to defend. And when they've gone into battle, as they do today, they have done so with a conviction that the country that sent them there is worth their sacrifice, that it stands for something more than the sum of our individual interests.\nMay God bless all who have served, all who serve today, as he has blessed us with their service. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are now being tested by an array of threats that are more complex more numerous and just as deeply and deadly as I can recall in my lifetime. We face a consequential choice, and make no mistake, it is a choice. We can choose to follow a declining path toward a future that is dimmer and more dangerous that our past, or we can choose to reform our failing government, revitalize our ailing economy and renew the foundations of our power and leadership in the world. That is what's at stake in this election. (Cheers, applause.)\nUnfortunately, for four years, for four years, we've drifted away from our proudest traditions of global leadership, traditions that are truly bipartisan. We've let the challenges we face both at home and abroad become much harder to solve. We can't afford to stay on that course any longer. We can't afford to cause our friends and allies, from Latin America, to Europe, to Asia, to the Middle East and especially in Israel, a nation under existential threat, to doubt America's leadership. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA!\nJOHN MCCAIN: We can't afford to give governments in Russia and China a veto over how we defend our interests and the progress of our values in the world.\n(Cheers, applause.) We can't afford to have the security of our nation 鈥斅爓e can't afford to have the security of our nation, and those who bravely defend it, endangered because their government leaks the secrets of their heroic operations to the media! (Cheers, applause.)\nI believe we can't afford to substitute a political timetable for a military strategy. By committing to withdraw from Afghanistan before peace can be achieved and sustained, the president has discouraged our friends and emboldened our enemies, which is why our commanders did not recommend these decisions and why they have said it puts our mission at much greater risk. We can't afford another $500 billion in cuts in our defense budget on top of the nearly 500 billion (dollars) in cuts that the president is already making. (Cheers, applause.)\nHis own secretary of defense has said that cutting our military by nearly a trillion dollars would be devastating, and yet the president is playing no leadership role in preventing this crippling blow to our military.\nA wise congressman from Wisconsin has said: Our fiscal policy and our foreign policy are on a collision course. And that man is our next vice president, Paul Ryan. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut most of all, we can't afford to abandon the cause of human freedom. When long-suffering peoples demand liberation from their jailers and torturers and tyrants, the leader of the free world must stand with them.\nUnfortunately, this is not happening. When Iranians rose up by the millions against their oppressive rulers; when they beseeched our president, chanting in English, are you with us or are you with them; when the entire world watched as a brave young woman named Neda was shot and bled to death in a street in Tehran, the president missed an historic opportunity to throw America's full moral support behind an Iranian revolution that shared one of our highest interests, ridding Iran of a brutal dictatorship that terrorized the Middle East and threatens the world. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe situation is far worse in Syria. What began as peaceful protests has now become, 18 months later, a savage and unfair fight. With the full backing of Iran and Hezbollah and Russia, with tanks and helicopters and fighter jets, Bashar Assad is murdering men, women and children. More than 20,000 people have perished. Extremists are gaining ground, and the conflict is becoming more dangerous by the day for our allies and for us.\nIn other times, when other courageous people fought for their freedom against sworn enemies of the United States, American presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have acted to help them prevail.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nSadly for the lonely voices of dissent in Syria and Iran and elsewhere in the world who feel forgotten in their darkness and sadly for us as well, our president is not being true to our values. (Cheers, applause.) For the sake of the cause of freedom, for the sake of people who are willing to give their lives so their fellow citizens can determine their own futures and for the sake of our nation, the nation founded on the idea that all people everywhere have the right to freedom and justice, we must return to our best traditions of American leadership and support those who face down the brutal tyranny of their oppressors and our enemies. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nJOHN MCCAIN: My friends, across the world, people are seizing control of their own destinies. They are liberating themselves from oppressive rulers. And they want America's support. They want America's assistance as they struggle to live in peace and security, to expand opportunity for themselves and their children, to replace the injustices of despots with the institutions of democracy and freedom. America must be on the right side of history. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe demand for our leadership in the world has never been greater. People don't want less of America; they want more.\nEverywhere I go in the world, people tell me that they still have faith in America. What they want to know is whether we still have faith in ourselves.\nI trust that Mitt Romney has that faith, and I trust him to lead us. (Cheers, applause.) I trust him to affirm our nation's exceptional character and responsibilities. I trust him to know that our security and economic interests are inextricably tied to the progress of our values. I trust him to know that if America doesn't lead, our adversaries will. And the world will go darker, poorer and much more dangerous.\nI trust him to know that an American president always, always, always stands up for the rights and freedoms and justice of all people. (Cheers, applause.) I trust Mitt Romney to know that good can triumph over evil, that justice can vanquish tyranny, that love can conquer hate, that the desire for freedom is eternal and universal and that America is still the best hope of mankind. (Applause.)\nAnd now, my fellow Americans, let's elect our next commander in chief and the next leader of the free world, my friend Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)",

I am proud to be one of the 212,000 service women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! (Cheers, applause.)\nJEANINE MCDONNELL: Thank you.\nAs a 24-year-old Virginian in Iraq, I worked with some of the most courageous men and women this nation has to offer. And we were united in a singular cause: to protect the nation that we love. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt has been my privilege to serve alongside heroes of every service. Defending this nation and its citizens is not without sacrifice for service members and the families that support them. And that is why that we need leaders who don't play chicken with our nation's defense. (Cheers, applause.) We need leaders who will invest in defense 鈥斅爊ot abandon it. (Cheers, applause.) And that is why we need Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nNow, it is my distinct honor to introduce Chris Devon Young, a hero in his own right, a former Coast Guardsmen and a two-time Paralympic Gold Medalist in alpine skiing.\nChris. (Cheers, applause.)\nCHRIS DEVON YOUNG: Thank you. It is wonderful to be here with you tonight.\nIn 1982, while flying in heavy fog during a Coast Guard mission, our plane crashed, leaving me paralyzed from the waist down.\nWhile my career as a Coast Guardsman ended, a new world of service began for me. Twenty-seven years ago, this California boy was introduced to ski racing at the first Veterans Administration winter sports clinic. I decided then and there to dedicate to my life to racing and coaching other injured veterans.\nBeing a gold medal paralympian gives me a whole new way to honor and serve my country. Being the coach 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燽eing the coach of paralympic medalists gives me a way to honor and serve others.\nAnd I believe that we can all serve, no matter what our challenges, because it's not about what you've lost in life, but rather what you are able to give. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow it is my honor to introduce a hero who's given of himself regardless of the price. He is the son and grandson of admirals. He's a decorated naval pilot, a war hero and THE senior senator of the great state of Arizona, Senator John McCain. (Cheers, applause.)",

BUSH: It was fun just walking in and seeing your own son be the president of the United States.\nGEORGE W. BUSH: And I remember visiting Dad in the Oval Office when he was president and how much reverence he treated the office. And I tried to do the same thing. I mean, the Oval Office is a place where you make decisions and welcome dignitaries and welcome some friends. But it's a place that always has to be treated with respect and dignity.\nBARBARA BUSH: Lech Walesa's visit to the White House 鈥斅爓e'd sort of been involved with him in Poland and gotten to know him. And he came to the White House, and he really spoke no English. But he mentioned freedom and stooped down as he was getting the award the president can give a foreigner and kissed the ground. And I must say I was very emotional.\nGEORGE W. BUSH: The first time Vladimir Putin came to visit Washington 鈥斅燼nd the sun was pouring through the windows, and I mean, the Oval Office just sparkled. And the door opened up, and in came President Putin. And his first words were, my God.\nWhen Dad was president he kindly would invite all of us up to the White House.

But right after that, I got a big sack of correspondence to sign and go through, and in the correspondence was a letter from Barney 鈥斅�(laughter) 鈥斅燼nd he wrote and said he was so embarrassed, he was really sorry, he'd made a mistake.

Thank you.\nYou know, when the Supreme Court upheld \"Obamacare,\" the first words out of my mouth were, I still think it's unconstitutional. (Cheers, applause.) The left-wing blogs were merciless. Even my wife said, can't you please just count to 10 before you speak? (Laughter.)\nSo I've had time to count to 10, and you know what?\nI still think it's unconstitutional. (Cheers, applause.) Do you think Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have changed their mind?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nRAND PAUL: I think if James Madison himself, the father of the Constitution, were here today, he would agree with me. The whole damn thing is still unconstitutional. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis debate is not new, and it's not over. Hamilton and Madison fought from the beginning about how the government would be limited by the enumerated powers. Madison was unequivocal: the powers of the federal government are few and defined. The 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐he power to tax and spend is restricted by the enumerated powers.\nSo how do we fix this travesty of justice? There's only one option left. We have to have a new president. (Cheers, applause.) When I heard the current president say, you didn't build that, I was first insulted, then I was angered and then I was saddened that anyone in our country, much less the president of the United States, believes that roads create business success and not the other way around. (Mixed cheers and boos, applause.)\nAnyone who so fundamentally misunderstands American greatness is uniquely unqualified to lead this great nation. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe great and abiding lesson of American history, particularly the Cold War, is that the engine of capitalism, the individual, is mightier than any collective. American 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燗merican inventiveness and desire to build developed because we were guaranteed the right to own our success. For most of our history, no one dared tell Americans, you didn't build that.\nIn Bowling Green, Kentucky, the Tang (sp) family owns the Great American Donut Shop. Their family fled war-torn Cambodia to come to this country. My kids and I love to eat doughnuts, so we go there frequently. The Tangs (sp) work long hours. Mrs. Tang (sp) told us that the family works through the night to make doughnuts. The Tang (sp) family have become valedictorians and National Merit Scholars. The Tangs (sp) from Cambodia are an American success story. So Mr. President, don't you go telling the Tang (sp) family that they didn't build that. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen you say 鈥斅爓hen you say they didn't built it, you insult each and every American who ever got up at the crack of dawn. You insult any American who ever put on overalls or a suit. You insult any American who ever studied late into the night to become a doctor or a lawyer.\nYou insult the dishwasher, the cook, the waitress. You insult anyone who has ever dragged themselves out of bed to strive for something better for themselves and their children.\nMy great-grandfather, like many, came to this country in search of the American dream. No sooner had he stepped off the boat than his father died. He arrived in Pittsburgh as a teenager with nothing, not a penny. He found the American dream: not great wealth, but a bit of property in a new land that gave him hope for his children. In America, as opposed to the old country, success was based on merit. Probably America's greatest asset was that for the first time, success was not based on who you were but what you did. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy grandfather would live to see his children become doctors and ministers, accountants and professors. He would even live to see one of his sons, a certain congressman from Texas 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼 certain congressman from Texas, run for the presidency of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nImmigrants have flocked to our shores seeking freedom. Our forebears came full of hopes and dreams. So consistent and prevalent were these aspirations that they crystallized into a national yearning we call the American dream. No other country has a dream so inextricably associated with the spirit of its people.\nIn 1982 an American sailor, John Mooney (sp), wrote a letter to his parents that captures the essence of the American dream. He wrote, dear Mom and Dad, today we spotted a boat in the water, and we rendered assistance. We picked up 65 Vietnamese refugees. As they approached the ship, they were all waving and trying as best they could to say, hello, American sailor. Hello, freedom man. It's hard to see a boat full of people like that and not get a lump somewhere between chin and belly button, and it really makes one proud and glad to be an American. It reminds us of all 鈥斅爓hat America has been, a place a man or a woman can come to for freedom.\nHung and Twan Tring (ph) are brothers and friends of mine. They came to America on one of those leaky boats. They were attacked at sea by pirates. Their family's wealth was stolen. Twan (ph) spent a year on a South Pacific island, existing on a cup of rice and water, until he was allowed to come to America.\nNow both of these men and their family are proud Americans. Hung (ph) owns his own business, and Twan (ph) manages a large company. They are the American dream.\nSo, Mr. President, don't go telling the Tring (ph) family, you didn't build that. (Cheers, applause.) When the president says, you didn't build that, he's flat-out wrong. Businessmen and -women did build that. Businessmen and -women did earn their success. Without the success of American business, we wouldn't have any roads, bridges or schools.\nMr. President, you say the rich must pay their fair share.\nBut when you seek to punish the rich, the jobs that are lost are those of the poor and the middle class. (Cheers, applause.) When you seek to punish Mr. ExxonMobil, you punish the secretary who owns ExxonMobil stock. When you block the Keystone pipeline, you punish the welder who works on the pipeline. (Cheers, applause.)\nOur nation faces a crisis. America wavers. Unfortunately, we are one of a select group of countries whose debt now equals their gross domestic product. The republic of Washington and Jefferson is now in danger of becoming the democracy of debt and despair. Our great nation is coming apart at the seams, and the president just seems to point fingers and blame others.\nPresident Obama's administration will add nearly $6 trillion to our national debt in just one term. (Boos.) And I'm hoping it's just one term. (Cheers, applause.) This explosion of debt is unconscionable and unsustainable. Mr. President, we will not let you bankrupt this great nation. (Cheers, applause.)\nRepublicans and Democrats alike, though, must slay their sacred cows.\nRepublicans must acknowledge that not every dollar spent on the military is necessary or well-spent. (Cheers, applause.) Democrats must admit that domestic welfare and entitlements must be reformed. (Cheers, applause.)\nRepublicans and Democrats must replace fear with confidence, confidence that no terrorist and no country will ever conquer us if we remain steadfast to the principles of our founding documents. (Cheers, applause.) We have nothing to fear except our own unwillingness to defend what is naturally ours: our God-given rights. (Cheers, applause.) We have nothing to fear that should cause us to forget or relinquish our rights as free men and women. (Cheers, applause.) To thrive, we must believe in ourselves again, and we must never, never trade our liberty for any fleeting promise of security. (Cheers, applause.)\nAuthor Paul Kengor writes of a brisk evening in a small town in Illinois, returning home from a basketball game at the YMCA, an 11- year-old boy stunned by the sight of his father sprawled out in the snow on the front porch. He was drunk, his son would later remember, dead to the world, crucified. The dad's hair was soaked with melted snow matted against his reddened face. The boy stood over his father for a minute or two. He simply wanted to let himself in the door and pretend his dad wasn't there. Instead, he grabbed a fistful of overcoat and he heaved his dad into the bedroom, away from the weather's harm and the neighbors' attention. This young boy would become the man Ronald Reagan 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐he man we know as Ronald Reagan 鈥斅爓hose sunny optimism and charisma shined so brightly that it cured the malaise of the late '70s, a confidence that beamed so broadly that it pulled us through a serious recession and a faith that tugged so happily at the hearts of all that a generation of Democrats became Republicans. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe American dream is that any among us could become the next Thomas Edison, the next Henry Ford, the next Ronald Reagan. But to lead us forward away from this looming debt crisis, it will take someone who believes in America's greatness, who believes in and can articulate the American dream, someone who has created jobs, someone who understands and appreciates what makes America great, someone who will lead our party and our nation forward.\nI believe that someone is our nominee, Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs Reagan said, our freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction. If our freedom is taken, the American dream will wither and die. To lead we must transform the coldness of austerity into the warm, vibrant embrace of prosperity. To overcome the current crisis, we must appreciate and applaud American success. We must step forward unabashedly and proclaim, you did build that. (Cheers, applause.) You earned that. You worked hard; you studied; you labored; you did build that. (Cheers, applause.) And you deserve America's undying gratitude. For you, the individual, are the engine of America's greatness. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",

They're either here to make a point, or they're here to make a difference. Ron Paul is the only one I know who's made a difference by making a point.\nRON PAUL: We need lower taxes, less regulations, and we need to free up the market.\nMR. : He's been an absolute fiscal hawk, one of the most fiscally conservative members in the history of the Congress.\nMR. : I can guarantee you we wouldn't have a $16 trillion debt if we had 435 Ron Pauls in Congress.\nMR. : The more I think about him over the years, the more inspiring it is of what he's done, and not being afraid of anything but willing to stand for what he thought was right. Ron Paul was tea party before there was a tea party.\nMR. : If you want honesty, integrity, look to Ron Paul. And that's based on his faith and based on his belief in the Constitution.\nMR. : He's willing to do things that other people aren't willing to do because his convictions are so deep.\nRON PAUL: As long as we live beyond our means, we are destined to live beneath our means.\nRAND PAUL: But one of the extraordinary things about my father is that, you know, the lobbyists don't even come by his office.

    "MITCH MCCONNELL: Ladies and gentlemen, we're here this week for the simple reason that our nation is in desperate need of leadership, and we believe Mitt 鈥斅爓e believe Mitt Romney is the man for this moment. (Cheers, applause.) That's the hopeful message coming from Tampa this week. After four long years, help is on the way. (Cheers, applause.)\nAmerica is about to turn the page on Barack Obama's four-year experiment in big government. And it starts by renewing our belief that we are called to do something better. Over the past four years, Americans have been led to believe we're just like everybody else, that America really isn't unique.\nBut it's not true. We are 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅爓e are different 鈥斅爊ot because of where we were born, but because of who we are as a people, because of what we have in here.\nThe president scoffs at this idea. To him this kind of thinking is the problem, not the solution. That's why he's spent the last four years lowering Americans' expectations instead of raising them. That's why he's been missing in action on the greatest challenges of our day. What this administration has in mind for America isn't a renewal; it's a great leveling out.\nIt wants the kind of government-imposed equality that in a single generation transformed Western Europe from a place where for centuries 鈥斅爁or centuries high achievement and discovery and innovation were celebrated and prized to a place where they have elections about whether people should have to work, where they make promises they can't keep and write checks they can't cash. But that's not who we are. It doesn't even occur to an American that someone else will solve their problems. Americans take pride in solving problems for themselves. And if we fail, we get back up and try again. It's what we do. (Cheers, applause.) It's who we are.\nNow, the president may want to give up on the problems we face and simply manage the decline.\nBut the American people don't, and that's why this election is so very important. It's a choice about who we are. Are we still a country that takes risks, that innovates, that believes anything is possible? Or are we a country that is resigned to whatever liberty the government decides to dish out? Now, I tell students all the time the only way to fail in America is to quit. And I truly believe that that's the case, and I know Mitt Romney does too. (Cheers, applause.)\nFor four years, for four long years, Barack Obama's been running from the nation's problems. He hasn't been working to earn re- election; he's been working to earn a spot on the PGA Tour. (Laughter, applause.) Mitt Romney has spent his entire life finding ways to solve problems. Mitt Romney has never been resigned to what somebody else said was possible. He cut his own path. That's why he believes in his heart that America has a future full of opportunity and hope. And that's why when Mitt Romney looks down the road, he sees a country that is ready for a comeback. (Cheers, applause.) And I believe firmly that he's the man to lead that comeback. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs we meet here tonight, America is suffering through an economic calamity of truly historic dimensions.\nSome are calling it the slowest recovery in our nation's entire 236- year history. My friends, to call this a recovery is an insult to recoveries. (Applause.)\nNow, this is not the result of forces that are beyond our control. It is not the result of some sinister political plot, as some of the more paranoid inhabitants of the left-wing fever swamps would have you believe. It is the result of the policies that Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress spent two full years carefully putting into place, and which they are determined to continue if they win again. (Applause.) These are policies that are meant to gently, gently lull us into a state of lower expectations and diminished dreams.\nWe've gotten a preview of this future over the past few years. We hear the stories every day now: the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn't know he lost his job, the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that's open to her, after four years of study and a pile of debt, is her parents' door. These are the faces of the Obama economy.\nAnd this is America's future if we don't do something to change the course this president seems perfectly content to leave us on. (Cheers, applause.) So think about it.\nOn the same day we learned that unemployment went up in 44 out of 50 states last month 鈥斅�(boos) 鈥斅爐he president of the United States took the airwaves to tell the people of Albuquerque that he enjoys green chili but prefers red. We know what the president's got on his iPod, but we don't know what he plans to do about the looming tax hike that could trigger yet another serious recession that would result in even more Americans losing their jobs.\nSo ladies and gentlemen, America cannot afford another four years of this. (Cheers, applause.) For four years, Americans have waited for the faintest light to flicker at the end of the tunnel. And this president has let them down again and again and again. It's time to move on. It's time for a leader who will lead. (Cheers, applause.) That leader is Mitt Romney. Thank you very much. (Cheers, applause.)",

Now, she made sure we all knew who set the rules. Tell it to you this way: In the automobile of life, dad was just a passenger. Mom was the driver. (Laughter, applause.)\nNow, they both lived hard lives. Dad grew up in poverty. And after returning from Army service, he worked at the Breyers Ice Cream plant in the 1950s. Now, with that job and the GI Bill he put himself through Rutgers University at night to become the first in his family to earn a college degree. (Cheers, applause.) And our 鈥斅爋ur first family picture 鈥斅爋ur first family picture was on his graduation day, with my mom beaming next to him, six months pregnant with me.\nNow, mom also came from nothing. She was raised by a single mother who took three different buses every day to get to work. And mom spent the time that she was supposed to be a kid actually raising children 鈥斅爃er younger brother and younger sister. She was tough as nails and didn't suffer fools at all.\nAnd the truth was, she couldn't afford to. She spoke the truth 鈥斅燽luntly, directly and without much varnish. I am her son. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nI was her son 鈥斅營 was her son as I listened to \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" with my high school friends on the Jersey Shore.\nI 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅營 was her son when I moved into that studio apartment with Mary Pat to start a marriage that's now 26 years old. (Applause.)\nI was her son as I coached our sons Andrew and Patrick on the fields of Mendham, and as I watched with pride as our daughters Sarah and Bridget marched with their soccer teams in the Labor Day parade.\nAnd I'm still her son today, as governor, following the rules she taught me: to speak from the heart and to fight for your principles. You see, mom never thought you'd get extra credit just for speaking the truth.\nAnd the greatest lesson that mom ever taught me, though, was this one: She told me there would be times in your life when you have to choose between being loved and being respected. Now, she said to always pick being respected. (Applause.) She told me that love without respect was always fleeting, but that respect could grow into real and lasting love.\nNow, of course, she was talking about women. (Laughter.) But I have learned over time that it applies just as much to leadership. In fact, I think that advice applies to America more than ever today. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou see 鈥斅爏ee, I believe we have become paralyzed 鈥斅爌aralyzed 鈥斅燽y our desire to be loved. Now, our Founding Fathers had the wisdom to know that social acceptance and popularity were fleeting and that this country's principles needed to be rooted in strengths greater than the passions and the emotions of the times.\nBut our leaders today have decided it's more important to be popular 鈥斅爐o be popular, to say and do what's easy and say yes, rather than to say no, when no is what is required. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn recent years 鈥斅爄n recent years, we as a country have too often chosen the same path. It's been easy for our leaders to say not us and not now, in taking on the really tough issues. And unfortunately we've stood silently by and let them get away with it.\nBut tonight I say: Enough. (Cheers, applause.) Tonight 鈥斅爐onight I say: Together let's make a much different choice. Tonight we are speaking up for ourselves and stepping up. Tonight we're beginning to do what is right and what is necessary to make America great again. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are demanding that our leaders stop tearing each other down, and work together to take action on the big things facing America. Tonight we are going to do what my mother taught me. Tonight we're going to choose respect over love. (Cheers, applause.)\nSee, we're not afraid. We are not afraid. We're taking our country back because we are the great-grandchildren of men and women who broke their backs in the name of American ingenuity, the grandchildren of the \"Greatest Generation,\" the sons and daughters of immigrants, the brothers and sisters of everyday heroes, the neighbors of entrepreneurs and firefighters, teachers and farmers, veterans and factory workers and everyone in between who shows up, not just on the big days or the good days, but on the bad days and the hard days, each and every day, all 365 of them.\nYou see, we are the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow it's up to us. We must lead the way our citizens live, to lead as my mother insisted I live, not by avoiding truths, especially the hard ones, but by facing up to them and being better for it. We can't afford to do anything less. Now, I know this because this was the challenge in New Jersey. When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth and jobs (sic) and people leaving our state, or I could do the job people elected me to do, to do the big things.\nNow, there were those who said it couldn't be done, that the problems were too big, too politically charged and too broken to fix, that we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow. Now, they said it was impossible 鈥斅爐his is what they told me 鈥斅爐o cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor, that it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time with an $11 billion deficit. But three years later we have three balanced budgets in a row, with lower taxes. We did it. (Cheers, applause.)\nThey said 鈥斅爐hey said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics, to take on the public sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy.\nBut with bipartisan leadership, we saved taxpayers $132 billion over 30 years and saved retirees their pensions. We did it. (Cheers, applause.)\nThey said 鈥斅爐hey said it was impossible to speak the truth to the teachers union. (Cheers.) They were just too powerful. A real teacher tenure reform that demands accountability and ends the guarantee of a job for life regardless of performance, they said it would never happen. But for the first time in 100 years, with bipartisan support, you know the answer. We did it. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, the disciples of yesterday's politics, they always underestimate the will of the people. They assumed our people were selfish, that when told of the difficult problems, the tough choices and the complicated solutions, that they would simply turn their backs, that they would decide it was every man for himself. They were wrong. The people of New Jersey stepped up. They shared in the sacrifice.\nAnd you know what else they did? They rewarded politicians who led instead of politicians who pandered. (Cheers, applause.) But you know, we shouldn't be surprised. We shouldn't be surprised. We've never been a country to shy away from the truth. Our history shows that we stand up when it counts, and it's this quality that has defined America's character and our significance in the world.\nNow, I know this simple truth and I am not afraid to say it: our ideas are right for America and their ideas have failed America. (Cheers, applause.)\nLet me be clear with the American people tonight. Here's what we believe as Republicans and what they believe as Democrats.\nWe believe in telling hardworking families the truth about our country's fiscal realities, telling them what they already know 鈥斅爐he math of federal spending does not add up. With $5 trillion in debt added over the last four years, we have no other option but to make the hard choices, cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of this government. (Cheers, applause.)\nWant to know what they believe? They believe that the American people don't want to hear the truth about the extent of our fiscal difficulties. They believe the American people need to be coddled by big government. They believe the American people are content to live the lie with them. They're wrong.\nWe believe in telling our seniors the truth about our overburdened entitlements. We know seniors not only want these programs to survive, but they just as badly want them secured for their grandchildren. Our seniors are not selfish. (Cheers, applause.)\nHere's what they believe. They believe seniors will always put themselves ahead of their grandchildren. And here's what they do: they prey on their vulnerabilities and scare them with misinformation for the single, cynical purpose of winning the next election.\nHere's their plan: Whistle a happy tune while driving us off the fiscal cliff 鈥斅燼s long as they are behind the wheel of power when we fall. (Applause.)\nNow, we believe that the majority of teachers in America know our system must be reformed to put students first so that America can compete. Now, teachers don't teach to become rich or famous. They teach because they love children. We believe 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爓e believe that we should honor and reward the good ones while doing what's best for our nation's future 鈥斅燿emanding accountability, demanding higher standards and demanding the best teacher in every classroom in America. (Cheers, applause.)\nGet ready. Get ready. Here's what they believe: They believe the educational establishment will always put themselves ahead of children, that self-interest will always trump common sense. They believe in pitting unions against teachers, educators against parents, lobbyists against children.\nThey believe in teacher's unions. We believe in teachers. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe believe 鈥斅爓e believe that if we tell the people the truth, that they will act bigger than the pettiness we see in Washington, D.C. We believe it's possible to forge bipartisan compromise and stand up for our conservative principles. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou see, because it's always been the power of our ideas, not our rhetoric, that attracts people to our party. We win when we make it about what needs to be done. We lose when we play along with their game of scaring and dividing. (Cheers, applause.) For 鈥斅爉ake no mistake about it, everybody 鈥斅爐he problems are too big to let the American people lose: the slowest economic recovery in decades; a spiraling, out-of-control deficit; and an education system that's failing to compete in the world.\nIt doesn't matter how we got here. There's enough blame to go around. What matters is what we do now.\nSee 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅營 know 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅營 know we can fix our problems. When there are people in the room who care more about doing the job they were elected to do than they worry about winning re-election, it's possible to work together, achieve principled compromise and get results for the people who gave us these jobs in the first place. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe people have no patience for any other way anymore. It's simple. We need politicians to care more about doing something and less about being something. (Cheers, applause.) And believe me, believe me, if we can do this in a blue state like New Jersey with a conservative Republican governor, Washington, D.C., is out of excuses. (Cheers, applause.)\nLeadership delivers. Leadership counts. Leadership matters.\nAnd here's the great news I came here tonight to bring you: We have this leader for America. We have a nominee who will tell us the truth and who will lead with conviction. And now he has a running mate who will do the same. We have Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan, and we need to make them the next president and vice president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou see 鈥斅爕ou see, because I know Mitt Romney. I know Mitt Romney, and Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to put us back on a path to growth and create good-paying private sector jobs again in America. Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the torrent of debt that is compromising our future and burying our economy. Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world's greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe ended an era of absentee leadership without purpose or principle in New Jersey. I'm here to tell you tonight it is time to end this era of absentee leadership in the Oval Office and send real leaders back to the White House. (Applause.) America needs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and we need them right now. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow 鈥斅燽ut we got to tell each other the truth, right?\nListen, there is doubt and fear for our future in every corner of our country. I have traveled all over the country and I have seen this myself. These feelings are real. This moment is real. And it's a moment like this where some skeptics wonder if American greatness is over. They wonder how those who have come before us had the spirit and the tenacity to lead America to a new era of greatness in the face of challenge. Not to look around and say \"not me,\" but to look around and say, \"yes, me.\"\nNow, I have an answer tonight for the skeptics and the naysayers, the dividers and the defenders of the status quo: I have faith in us. I know 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅營 know we can be the men and women our country calls on us to be tonight. I believe in America and her history.\nAnd there's only one thing missing now, leadership. It takes leadership that you don't get from reading a poll. You see, Mr. President, real leaders don't follow polls. Real leaders change polls. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd that's what we need. That's what we need to do now. We need to change polls through the power of our principles. We need to change polls through the strength of our convictions.\nTonight, our duty is to tell the American people the truth. Our problems are big and the solutions will not be painless. We all must share in the sacrifice. And any leader that tells us differently is simply not telling the truth. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, I think tonight 鈥斅營 think tonight of the \"Greatest Generation.\" We look back and marvel at their courage 鈥斅爋vercoming the Great Depression, fighting Nazi tyranny, standing up for freedom around the world.\nWell, now it's our time to answer history's call, for make no mistake, every generation will be judged, and so will we. And what will our children and grandchildren say of us? Will they say we buried our heads in the sand; we assuaged ourselves with the creature comforts we've acquired; that our problems were too big, and we were too small; that someone else should make a difference, because we can't? Or will they say of us that we stood up and made the tough choices that needed to be made to preserve our way of life?\nYou see, I don't know about you, but I don't want my children and grandchildren to have to read in a history book what it was like to live in an American century. I don't want their only inheritance to be an enormous government that is overtaxed, overspent and overborrowed, a great people that's a second-class citizenship. I want them to live in a second American century, a second American century 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼 second American century of strong economic growth where those who are willing to work hard will have good-paying jobs to support their families and reach their dreams; a second American century where real American exceptionalism is not a political punchline, when it's evident to everyone in the world just by watching the way our government conducts its business every day and the way Americans live their lives; a second American century where our military is strong, our values our sure, our work ethic is unmatched and our Constitution remains a model for anyone in the world struggling for liberty. (Cheers, applause.)\nLet us choose a path that will be remembered for generations to come. Standing strong for freedom will make the next century as great an American century as the last one.\nYou see, this is the American way. We have never been victims of destiny; we have always been the masters of our own. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd I know 鈥斅營 know you agree with me on this. I will not be part of the generation that fails that test, and neither will you. (Cheers, applause.)\nAll right. All right, it's now time to stand up. Let's stand up! Everybody, stand up! (Cheers, applause.) Stand up! Because there's no time left to waste. If you're willing to stand up with me for America's future, I will stand up with you. If you're willing to fight with me for Mitt Romney, I will fight with you. If you're willing to hear the truth 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐o hear the truth about the hard road ahead and the rewards for America that truth will bear, I'm here to begin with you this new era of truth-telling.\nTonight we choose the path that has always defined our nation's history. Tonight we finally and firmly answer the call that so many generations have had the courage to answer before us. Tonight we stand up for Mitt Romney as the next president of the United States.\nAnd together 鈥斅�(extended cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼nd together 鈥斅燼nd together, everybody, together, we will stand up once again for American greatness for our children and grandchildren.\nGod bless you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nANN ROMNEY: Whoa! (Cheers, applause.) What a welcome! (Cheers, applause.) Thank you, and thank you, Luce.\nI can't wait to see what we're going to all do together. This is going to be so exciting! (Cheers, applause.)\nJust so you all know, the hurricane has hit landfall, and I think we should all take this moment and recognize that fellow Americans are in its path, and just hope and pray that all are 鈥斅爎emain safe and no life is lost and no property is lost.\nSo we should all be thankful for this great country and grateful for our first responders and all that keep us safe in this wonderful country. (Cheers, applause.)\nWell, I want to talk to you tonight not about politics and not about party. And while there are many important issues we'll hear discussed in this convention and throughout this campaign, tonight I want to talk to you from my heart about our hearts.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: We love you, Ann! (Cheers, applause.)\nANN ROMNEY: I want to talk not about what divides us but what holds us together as an American family. I want to talk to you tonight about that one great thing that unites us, that one great thing that brings us our greatest joy when times our good and the deepest solace in our dark hours. Tonight I want to talk to you about love.\nI want to talk to you about the deep and abiding love I have for a man I met at a dance many years ago and the profound love I have and I know we share for this country. I want to talk to you about that love so deep only a mother can fathom it, the love we have for our children and our children's children.\nAnd I want us to think tonight about the love we share for those Americans, our brothers and our sisters, who are going through difficult times, whose days are never easy, nights are always long and whose work never seems done. They are here among us tonight in this hall. They are here in neighborhoods across Tampa and all across America.\nThe parents who lie awake at night side by side, wondering how they'll be able to pay the mortgage or make the rent.\nThe single dad who's working extra hours tonight so that his kids can buy some new clothes to go back to school, can take a school trip or play a sport, so his kids can feel, you know, just like other kids.\nAnd the working moms who love their jobs but would like to work just a little less to spend more time with the kids, but that's just out of the question with this economy.\nOr how about that couple who would like to have another child but wonder how they'll afford it?\nI have been all across this country 鈥斅燼nd I know a lot of you guys 鈥斅�(laughs) 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅�(laughs) --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you.\nANN ROMNEY: 鈥斅燼nd I have seen and heard stories of how hard it is to get ahead now. You know what? I've heard your voices. They've said to me: I'm running in place, and we just can't get ahead.\nSometimes I think that late at night, if we were all silent for just a few moments and listened carefully, we could hear a collective sigh from the moms and dads across America who made it through another day and know that they'll make it through another one tomorrow, but in that end of the day moment, they just aren't sure how.\nAnd if you listen carefully, you'll hear the women sighing a little bit more than the men. It's how it is, isn't it? It's the moms who have always had to work a little harder to make everything right. It's the moms of this nation 鈥斅爏ingle, married, widowed 鈥斅爓ho really hold this country together.\nWe're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, and we are the daughters. You know it's true, don't you? (Cheers, applause.)\nI love you women! (Cheers, applause, laughs.) And I hear your voices.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: We love Ann! We love Ann! We love Ann!\nANN ROMNEY: (Laughs.) There's my 鈥斅爏ome of my favorite fans down there. (Cheers.)\nYou are the ones that have to do a little bit more, and you know what it's like to work a little harder during the day to earn the respect you deserve at work. And then you come home at night and help with the book report, just because it has to be done. You know what those late night phone calls with an elderly parent are like and the long weekend drives just to see how they're doing. You know the fastest route to the local emergency room and which doctors actually answer the phone calls when you call at night. By the way, I know all about that.\nYou know what it's like to sit in that graduation ceremony and wonder how it was that so many long days turned into years that went by so quickly.\nYou are the best of America. You 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爕ou are the hope of America. There would not be an America without you. Tonight, we salute you and sing your praises. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm not sure if men really understand this, but I don't think there's a woman in America who really expects her life to be easy. In our own ways, we all know better. You know what, and that's fine; we don't want easy. But the last few years have been harder than they needed to be. It's all the little things. The 鈥斅爐he price at the pump you just can't believe. The grocery bills that just get bigger. All those things that used to be free, like school sports, are one more bill to pay. It's all the little things that pile up to become big things. And the big things 鈥斅爐he good jobs, the chance at college, that home you want to buy 鈥斅爅ust get harder.\nEverything has become harder. We're too smart to know there aren't easy answers, but we're not dumb enough to accept that there aren't better answers. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd that is where this boy I met at a high school dance comes in. His name is Mitt Romney, and you should really get to know him. (Cheers, applause.) I could tell you why I fell in love with him. He was tall, laughed a lot. He was nervous; girls like that. It shows the guy's a little intimidated. He was nice to my parents, but he was also really glad when they weren't around. (Laughter.) I don't mind that. But more than anything, he made me laugh.\nSome of you might not know this, but I am the granddaughter of a Welsh coal miner. (Cheers, applause.) He was determined 鈥斅爃e was determined that his kids get out of the mines. My dad got his first job when he was 6 years old in a little village in Wales called Nantyffyllon cleaning bottles at The Colliers Arms.\nWhen he was 15, Dad came to America. In our country, he saw hope and an opportunity to escape from poverty. He moved to a small town in the great state of Michigan. (Cheers, applause.) Michigan. (Chuckles.) There he started the business, one he built by himself, by the way. (Chuckles.) (Cheers, applause.) He 鈥斅爃e raised a family, and he became mayor of our town.\nMy dad would often remind my brothers and me how fortunate we were to grow up in a place like America. He wanted us to have every opportunity that came with life in this country, and so he pushed us to be our best and give our all.\nInside the houses that lined the streets of our town, there were a lot of good fathers teaching their sons and daughters those same values. I didn't know it at the time, but one of those dads was my future father-in-law, George Romney. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt's dad never graduated from college. Instead, he became a carpenter. He worked hard, he became the head of a car company and then the governor of Michigan.\nWhen Mitt and I met and fell in love, we were determined not to let anything stand in the way of our life together. I was an Episcopalian, he was a Mormon. We were very young, both still in college. There were many reasons to delay marriage. And you know what? We just didn't care. (Laughter.) We got married and moved into a basement apartment. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe walked to class together, shared the housekeeping, ate a lot of pasta and tuna fish. Our desk was a door propped up on sawhorses. Our dining room table was a fold-down ironing board in the kitchen. But those were the best days.\nThen our first son came along. All at once, I'm 22 years old with a baby and a husband who's going to business school and law school at the same time. And I can tell you, probably like every other girl who finds herself in a new life, far from family and friends, with a new baby and a new husband, that it dawned on me that I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. (Laughter.)\nWell, that was 42 years ago. I've survived. We now have five sons and 18 beautiful grandchildren. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm still in love with that boy I met at a high school dance, and he still makes me laugh. (Cheers, applause.)\nI read somewhere that Mitt and I have a storybook marriage. Well, let me tell you something: In the storybooks I read, there never were long, long rainy winter afternoons in a house with five boys screaming at once 鈥斅�(laughter) 鈥斅燼nd those storybooks never seemed to have a 鈥斅燾hapters called MS or breast cancer. A storybook marriage? Nope. Not at all. What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage. (Cheers, applause.)\nI know this good and decent man for what he is. He's warm and loving and patient. He has tried to live his life with a set of values centered on family, faith and love of one's fellow man. From the time we were first married, I've seen him spend countless hours helping others. I've seen him drop everything to help a friend in trouble, and been there when late-night calls of panic come from a member of our church whose child has been taken to the hospital.\nYou may not agree with Mitt's positions on issues or his politics 鈥斅燽y the way, Massachusetts is only 13 percent Republican, so it's not like it is a shock to me 鈥斅�(laughter) 鈥斅燽ut 鈥斅�(chuckles) 鈥斅燽ut let me say this to every American who is thinking about who should be our next president: No one will work harder, no one will care more and no one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live. (Extended cheers, applause.)\nIt's true that 鈥斅爄t's true that Mitt's been successful at each new challenge he's taken on. You know what? It actually amazes me to see his history of success being attacked. Are those really the values that made our country great?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: No!\nANN ROMNEY: As a mom of five boys, do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nANN ROMNEY: Do we send our children out in the world with the advice, try to do OK?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nANN ROMNEY: And let's be honest. If the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt Romney's success?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nANN ROMNEY: Of course not.\nMitt will be the first to tell you that he is the most fortunate man in the world. He had two loving parents who gave him strong values and taught him the value of work. He had the chance to get the education his father never had.\nBut as his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success. He built it. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt! Let's go, Mitt!\nANN ROMNEY: He stayed in Massachusetts after graduate school and got a job.\nI saw the long hours that started with that first job. I was there when he had a small group of friends talking about starting a new company. I was there when they struggled and wondered if the whole idea just wasn't going to work. Mitt's reaction was to work harder and press on.\nToday that company has become another great American success story. Has it made those who started the company successful 鈥斅爉ade them successful beyond their dreams? Yes, it has. It allowed us to give our sons the chance at good educations and made all those long hours of book reports and homework worth every minute. It's given us the deep satisfaction of being able to help others in ways that we could never have imagined. This is important. I want you to hear what I'm going to say.\nMitt doesn't like to talk about how he has helped others because he sees it as a privilege, not a political talking point. (Cheers, applause.) We are no different than the millions of Americans who quietly help their neighbors, their churches and their communities. They don't do it so that others will think more of them. They do it because there is no greater joy. Give, and it shall be given unto you. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut because this is America, that small company which grew has helped so many others lead better lives. The jobs that grew from the risk they took have become college educations and first homes. That success has helped fund scholarships, pensions and retirement funds. This is the genius of America. Dreams fulfilled? Help others launch new dreams. (Cheers, applause.)\nAt every turn in his life, this man I met in a 鈥斅燼t a high school dance has helped lift up others. He did it with the Olympics when many wanted to give up. He did it in Massachusetts, where he guided a state from economic crisis to unemployment of just 4.7 percent. Under Mitt, Massachusetts's schools were the best in the nation, the best. (Cheers, applause.) He started something that I really love. He started the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, which give the top 25 percent of high school graduates a four-year tuition- free scholarship. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis is the man America needs. (Cheers, applause.) This is the man who will wake up every day with a determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved, to fix what others say is beyond repair. This is the man who will work harder than anyone so that we can work a little less hard. I can't tell you what will happen over the next four years, but I can only stand here tonight as a wife and a mother and a grandmother, an American, and make you this solemn commitment: This man will not fail. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis man will not let us down. This man will lift up America.\nIt has been 47 years since that tall, kind of charming young man brought me home from our first dance. Not every day since has been easy. But he still makes me laugh, and never once did I have a single reason to doubt that I was the luckiest woman in the world tonight. (Cheers.)\nI said tonight I wanted to talk to you about love. Look into your hearts. This is our country. This is our future. These are our children and grandchildren.\nYou can trust Mitt. (Cheers, applause.) He loves America. He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance. Give him that chance. Give America that chance.\nGod bless each and every one of you, and God Bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nLUCE VELA FORTUNO: Good evening, Tampa. My name is Luce, and it is great to be here with you tonight.\nI am the proud mother of 20-year-old triplets, I'm a practicing attorney, a very proud Latina and a die-hard Republican. (Cheers, applause.) I am also the wife of someone we're extremely proud of back home in Puerto Rico, Luis Fortuno. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs a governor, he has unleashed a true Republican revolution that has already accomplished so much.\nIt is a success story of fiscal responsibility, controlled government spending, lower taxes and pro-growth policy.\nBut it is also one of caring and compassionate attention to a social and faith-based agenda of unprecedented reach and consequence. Through it all, I have stood by his side and learned what it takes to be the rock of support to a great leader, just like our next speaker has done for 43 years for our next president, Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnn's story is one of remarkable courage, tenacity, perseverance and commitment, a story that stands in its own right, one that inspires all who know her, a woman of faith, a devoted wife, a caring mother to five boys, a multiple sclerosis and cancer survivor, a tireless advocate and a timeless first lady of Massachusetts. (Cheers, applause.)\nFor decades, she's been a fighter who has championed the cause of disadvantaged children, been an advocate of teenage pregnancy prevention, a leader of faith- and community-based initiatives and an ambassador for multiple sclerosis awareness. Watching her during a recent visit to Puerto Rico, I marveled at her ability to 鈥斅�(inaudible) 鈥斅燾hildren, connect with the elderly and engage workers at a farmers market with such ease, heart and purpose that made people wonder who was that handsome gentleman next to her. (Laughter, applause.)\nNo wonder she's been Mitt Romney's secret weapon for 43 years. No wonder Mitt calls her his personal hero. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you my friend and the next first lady of the United States: Ann Romney. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nNIKKI HALEY: I love South Carolina. (Cheers, applause.)\nI am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every single day how blessed we were to live in this country. They loved the fact that only in America we could be as successful as we wanted to be and nothing would stand in our way.\nMy parents started a business out of the living room of our home, and 30-plus years later it was a multimillion-dollar company. But there wasn't a single day that it was easy, and there wasn't a single day that my mom and dad didn't put everything they had into making that business. So, President Obama, with all due respect, don't tell me that my parents didn't build their business. (Cheers, applause.)\nAlmost 45 years after my parents first became Americans, I stand before you and them tonight as the proud governor of South Carolina.\n(Cheers, applause.) We build things in the Palmetto State. We build planes, we build cars. We have three of the four largest tire producers in the world and are about to become the number-one tire- producing state in the country. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd not too long ago, The Wall Street Journal said anyone still thinking the U.S. has lost its manufacturing chops, hasn't been to South Carolina. (Cheers, applause.) We have so much potential and so much to be proud of.\nBut like so many states, we have our challenges, whether they be unemployment or education or poverty. And like so many of my governors, I work day in and day out to try and improve the lives of the people of my state. And sadly, the hardest part of my job continues to be this federal government, this administration and this president. (Applause.)\nAs I said, my parents loved it when they came to America. If you worked hard, the only things that could stop you were the limits you placed on yourself. Unfortunately, these past few years, you can work hard, try to be as successful as possible, follow the rules, and President Barack Obama will do everything he can to stand in your way.\nSouth Carolina recently passed one of the most innovative illegal immigration laws in the country. What did this president, who has failed to secure our borders and address this issue in any meaningful way, do? He sued us. If this president 鈥斅�(boos) 鈥斅爄f this president refuses to secure our borders, refuses to protect our citizens from the dangers of illegal immigration, then states have to take it upon ourselves. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe said in South Carolina that if you have to show a picture ID to buy Sudafed, if you have to show a picture ID to set foot on an airplane, then you should have to show picture ID to protect the 鈥斅爋ne of the most valuable 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爉ost central, sacred rights and blessed with in America, the right to vote. (Cheers, applause.) And what happened? President Obama stopped us.\nAnd now we come to the most unbelievable of them all. In 2009, South Carolina was blessed to welcome a great American company that chose to stay in our country to continue to do business. That company was Boeing. (Cheers, applause.) Boeing started a new line for their 787 Dreamliner, creating a thousand new jobs in South Carolina, giving our state a shot in the arm when we truly needed it. At the same time, they expanded their job numbers in Washington state by 2,000. Not a single person was hurt by their decision, not one. And what did President Obama and his National Labor Relations Board do? They sued this iconic American company. It was shameful and not worthy of the promise of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut we did one of the things we do best in South Carolina: we got loud. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe're fighters in South Carolina, and as we fought, we watched an amazing thing happen. You fought with us.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! (Applause.)\nNIKKI HALEY: And guess what. We won. (Cheers, applause.)\nA few months ago I sat on the tarmac at the Boeing facility in North Charleston and watched as a new mack daddy plane rolled onto the runway, sporting a \"made with pride in South Carolina\" decal and surrounded by 鈥斅爂et ready for it 鈥斅�6,000 nonunion employees 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燾heering, smiling and so proud of what they had built. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe deserve a president who won't sacrifice American jobs and American workers to pacify the bullying union bosses he counts as his political allies. American businesses deserve a federal government that doesn't stand in their way, not one that tries to chase them overseas. Fighting American ingenuity and innovation 鈥斅爐hat's what this president meant to South Carolina. That's what this president has meant to this governor. And that's why this governor will not stop fighting until we send him home, back to Chicago, and send Mitt and Ann Romney to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. (Cheers, applause.)\nI have had the pleasure of knowing Mitt Romney for several years now, and there is so much to appreciate about him. He fixes things. He's results-driven. He's taken broken companies and made them successful. He took a failing Olympics and made it a source of pride for our country. He went into a Democratic state, cut taxes, brought in jobs and improved education.\nOh, and by the way, he actually balanced his budget. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis is a man at peace with who he is, with the challenges he faces and with what he intends to accomplish. This is a man, not just a candidate looking to win an election but a leader yearning to return our nation to its greatest potential. And this is a man who has a silver bullet, his greatest asset by far, the next first lady of the United States, Ann Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnn is the perfect combination of strength and grace. She does what so many women in America do: She balances in an exceptional way. She raised five amazing boys, battled MS, is a breast cancer survivor and through it all was a true partner to Mitt.\nAnn Romney makes all women proud, by the way she has conducted her life as a strong woman of faith, as a mother, as a wife and as a true patriot. She's an amazing inspiration for me and for so many women across the country. (Cheers, applause.)\nNot too long ago I traveled to Michigan to campaign for the Romneys. (Cheers.) Towards the end of the day, two self-described independents came up to me and said, we like what we hear about Governor Romney. And although we don't know everything about him, what we do know without a doubt is that we deserve better than what we have today. (Cheers, applause.) They are so right.\nWe deserve a president who will turn our economy around. We deserve a president who will balance our budget. We deserve a president who will reform and protect our retirement programs for future generations. We deserve a president who will fight for American companies, not against them. (Applause.) We deserve a president who will strengthen our military, not destabilize them. (Applause.)\nAmerica deserves better than what we have today. We deserve a President Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, God bless you and may He continue to bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nARTUR DAVIS: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much for that warm welcome. Thank you so much.\nNow, some of you may know the last time I spoke at a convention it turned out I was in the wrong place. (Laughter.) So, Tampa, my fellow Republicans, thank you for welcoming me where I belong. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow 鈥斅爊ow, we got to get on with the show. We've got to get on with the show because we have a country to turn around.\nThis very night you nominated the most experienced executive to seek the presidency in 60 years in Mitt Romney.\nHe has no illusions about what makes America great. He doesn't confuse the presidency with celebrity or loftiness with leadership. What a difference four years makes. (Cheers, applause.) Now, the Democrats' negative ads do convince me that Governor Romney can't sing, but his record convinces me he knows how to lead, and I think you know what skill we need more. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, America is the land of second chances, and I gather in this close race you have room for the estimated 6 million of us who got it wrong in 2008 and who want to fix it. (Cheers, applause.) Maybe we should have known that night in Denver that things that begin with Styrofoam Greek columns and artificial smoke typically don't end well. (Laughter.) Maybe the Hollywood stars and the glamor blinded us a little. You thought it was the glare; some of us thought it was a halo.\nBut in all seriousness, do you know why so many of us believed? We led with our hearts and our dreams that we could be more inclusive than America had ever been, and no candidate had ever spoken so beautifully. But dreams meet daybreak. The jobless know what I mean. So have the families who wonder how this administration could wreck a recovery for three years and counting.\nSo many of those high-flown words have faded. Remember, my friends, the president saying of negative politics and untrue ads, not this time? Who knew \"not this time\" just meant not unless the economy is stuck and we can't run on our record? (Cheers, applause.)\nRemember 鈥斅爎emember when the president said of his own election, this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal? Who knew the plain English version of it was, Middle America, get ready to shell out 60 bucks to fill up your car? (Applause.)\nAnd in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement, who knew that when asked, could government conceivably impose a federal mandate requiring middle-class Americans to buy health insurance, whether they can afford it or not, that the Obama answer would be, yes, we can? (Laughter.)\nSo this time, in the name of 23 million of our children and parents and brothers and sisters who are officially unemployed, underemployed or who have stopped looking for work, let's put the poetry aside. Let's suspend the hype. Let's come down to earth and start creating jobs again. (Cheers, applause.) This time instead of moving oceans and healing planets, let's pay our bills down and pay down the debt on that wall, so we control our own future. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd of course 鈥斅燼nd of course we know that opportunity lies outside the reach of some of our people. We don't need flowery words about inequality to tell us that, and we don't need a party that has led while poverty and hunger rose to record levels to give us lectures about suffering.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, there are Americans who are listening to this speech right now who haven't always been with you. And I want you to let me talk just to them for a moment. I know how loaded up our politics is with anger and animosity. But I have to believe we can still make a case over the raised voices. There are Americans watching right now who voted for the president. But they're searching right now because they know that their votes didn't build the country they wanted. To those Democrats and independents whose minds are open to argument, listen closely to the Democratic Party that will gather in Charlotte, and ask yourself if you hear your voice in the clamor. Ask yourself if these Democrats still speak for you. When they say we have a duty to grow government even when we cannot afford it, does it sound like compassion to you?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nARTUR DAVIS: Or does it sound like recklessness? (Cheers.) When you hear the party that glorified Occupy Wall Street blast success, when you hear them minimize the genius of the men and women who make jobs out of nothing, is that what you teach your children about work?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nARTUR DAVIS: When they tell you America is this unequal place where the powerful trample on the powerless, does that sound like the country your children or your spouse risked their lives for in Iraq or Afghanistan?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nARTUR DAVIS: Do you even recognize the America they are talking about?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nARTUR DAVIS: And what can we say about a house that doesn't honor the pictures on its walls?\nJohn Kennedy asked us what we could do for America. This Democratic Party asks what can government give you. Don't worry about paying the bills; it's on your kids and grandkids. Bill Clinton took on his base and made welfare a thing you have to work for. This current crowd guts the welfare work requirement in the dead of night and won't tell the truth about it. (Cheers, applause.)\nBill Clinton, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson reached across the aisle and said, meet me in the middle. But their party rammed through a health care bill that took over one-sixth of our economy without accepting a single Republican idea, without winning a single vote in either house from a party whose constituents make up half of this country. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, the Democrats used to have a night when they presented a film of their presidential legends. Folks, if they do it in Charlotte, the theme song should be this year's hit: Now you're just somebody that I used to know.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nMy fellow Americans, when great athletes falter their coaches sometimes whisper to them, remember who you are, to call to their greatness at a moment when their bodies and spirit are too sapped to remember their strength. This sweet, blessed, God-inspired place called America is a champion that has absorbed some blows. But we bend. We do not break. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis is no dark hour. This is no dark hour.\nThis is the dawn before we remember who we are. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo may it be said of this time in our history, 2008 to 2011: Lesson learned; 2012: Mistake corrected. (Cheers, applause.)\nGod bless you. God bless you, Tampa. God bless you, America. Let's take this country back. Thank you so much. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nTED CRUZ: Good evening.\nI have the honor of standing before you this evening for one reason: because thousands and thousands of grassroots activists stood united, not for a candidate but for the sake of liberty. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are seeing something extraordinary, something that has dumbfounded the chattering class. It began in 2010 right here in Florida, in Utah, in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. It continued this summer in the state of Indiana, in Nebraska, in Wisconsin 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅燼nd in the Lone Star State. (Cheers, applause.) We are seeing a great awakening, a national movement of we the people brought together by what unites us: a shared love of liberty and an understanding of the unlimited potential of free men and free women.\nI want to tell you a love story. It's the story of all of us. It's a love story of freedom. It's the story of our Founding Fathers, who fought and bled for freedom and then crafted the most miraculous political document ever conceived, our Constitution. (Applause.)\nThe Framers understood that our rights come not from monarchs but from God 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅燼nd that those rights are secure only when government's power is restrained. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt's the story of the brave Texians in the city of Gonzales. When General Santa Anna demanded that they hand over their guns and the cannon that guarded their city, they responded with the immortal cry: \"Come and take it.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nIt's the story of the \"Greatest Generation,\" who rose up to confront the grotesque evil that was the Nazis and who ushered in the greatest ear of peace of prosperity the world has ever seen.\nIt's the story of civil rights pioneers like Dr. Martin Luther King who stood up to the scourge of discrimination and bravely championed that each of us must be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our character.\n(Cheers, applause.) It's the story of President Ronald Reagan, who turned back the growth of government and restored morning in America 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爓ho stood up against the oppressive evil of communism and demanded: \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Tear down this wall! (Cheers, applause.)\nTED CRUZ: It's the story of my mom, Irish and Italian, working- class, the first in her family ever to go to college. She became a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s. It's the story of my father, imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, beaten nearly to death. He fled to Texas in 1957, not speaking English, with a hundred dollars sewn into his underwear. He washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through college and to start a small business in the oil and gas industry.\nMy father is here today. When he came to America 鈥斅爀l no tenia nada, pero tenia corazon. (Cheers, applause.) Nothing. He had nothing. But he had heart, a heart for freedom. Thank you, Dad. (Cheers, applause.)\nIt's the story of each and every one of you. We are all the sons and daughters of those who risked everything for freedom. And each of us has a duty to pass that same liberty on to the next generation.\n(Applause.)\nAnd yet today many in Washington seem content to saddle our children with a crushing debt and a limited future. We're going broke.\nBut I'm here today with a word of encouragement. Millions of Americans are standing up, saying, we want our country back. (Cheers, applause.) Republicans, Democrats, independents 鈥斅爓e will not go down the path of Greece. We will not go quietly into the night. (Applause.)\nPresident Obama is immensely talented and a man of deep convictions, and yet his economic agenda is perilous indeed. This election presents a stark choice. We can continue down the road of the Obama Democrats, more and more spending, debt and government control of the economy, or we can return to the founding principles of our nation: free markets, fiscal responsibility and individual liberty. (Cheers, applause.)\nUnfortunately, President Obama's campaign is trying to divide America, to separate us into groups, telling seniors Medicare will be taken away, telling Hispanics that we're not welcome here and sending the vice president to preach a message of division.\nIt's tragic how far we've come from hope and change.\nAll of this is designed to distract from the real issues that matter: 23 million Americans struggling to find work, 16 trillion (dollars) in national debt and government takeovers of much of our economy.\nImagine for a moment if someone surreptitiously charged thousands of dollars on your credit cards, saddling your kids with debts they could never escape.\nMy wife, Heidi, and I are blessed with two little girls, Caroline and Catherine, four and one. When Caroline was born, our national debt was $10 trillion. Today, as the debt clock shows, it's $16 trillion 鈥斅爈arger than our gross domestic product.\nHow do we turn our nation around? President Obama thinks the answer is more and more government. (Boos.) Government is not the answer. (Cheers, applause.) You are not doing anyone a favor by creating dependency, destroying individual responsibility.\nFifty-five years ago, when my dad was a penniless teenager, thank God some well-meaning bureaucrat didn't put his arm around him and say: Let me take care of you. Let me give you a government check and make you dependent on government 鈥斅燼nd by the way, don't bother learning English.\nThat would have been utterly destructive.\nInstead, my parents worked together to build a small business, to provide for their family and to chart their own future. That's the American dream. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand that government doesn't create jobs. (Cheers, applause.) Entrepreneurs do.\nTwo-thirds of all new jobs in our economy come from small businesses, and 2.3 million Hispanics own small businesses. (Applause.) And yet this administration has waged a war on small businesses, a war that is costing our future and our opportunity.\nI want to close by asking a few questions, with apologies to Barack Obama. Can we restore the Constitution? (Cheers, applause.) Yes, we can. (Scattered laughter.) Can we retake the Senate?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes, we can! (Cheers, applause.)\nTED CRUZ: Can we repeal \"Obamacare\"?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes, we can! (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd can we defeat President Barack Obama?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes, we can! (Cheers, applause.)\nTED CRUZ: Stand together with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nRestore the American love story. That, my friends, is change we can believe in.\nThank you, and God bless you.

Rick!\nRICK SANTORUM: Thank you, Pennsylvania.\nIt is a great honor for me to be here tonight with the love of my wife 鈥斅爈ife, Karen, over here 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼nd my 93- year-old mother 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爁rom Florida, and some of our children.\nMy oldest son, John, wanted to be here tonight, but he's a first-year cadet at the Citadel. (Cheers, applause.) And so I just want to say to you, John, proud of you, son. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nI am a first-generation American. At the age of 7, my dad came from 鈥斅爐o Johnstown, Pennsylvania, from the mountains of northern Italy on a ship named Providence. How providential that one day his son would announce for president just down the road from the deep mines where his father, my grandfather, mined coal till he was 72 years old. (Applause.)\nWhen my grandfather died, I remembered as a kid kneeling at his casket and not being able to take my eyes off his thick, strong hands, hands that dug his path in life and gave his family a chance at living the American dream. Working the mines may not have been the dream he ever dreamed. I never dared to ask him. But I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped. America believed in him. That's why he believed in America. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy grandfather, like millions of other immigrants, didn't come here for some government guarantee of income equality or government benefits to take care of his family. In 1923 there were no government benefits for immigrants except one: freedom. (Cheers, applause.)\nUnder President Obama, the dream of freedom and opportunity has become a nightmare of dependency, with almost half of America receiving some sort of government assistance. It's no surprise fewer and fewer Americans are achieving their dreams and more and more parents are concerned their children won't realize theirs.\nPresident Obama spent four years and borrowed $5 trillion trying to convince you that he can make things better for you, to put your trust in him and the government to take care of every problem. The result? Massive debt, anemic growth and millions more unemployed. The president's plan didn't work for America, because that's not how America works.\nIn America 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅爄n America, we believe in freedom and the responsibility that comes with it to work hard to make the dream of reaching our God-given potential come true. We believe it 鈥斅爓e believe it because it still works. Even today, graduate from high school, work hard and get married before you have children, and the chance you will ever be in poverty is just 2 percent. Yet if you don't do these three things, you're 38 times more likely to end up in poverty.\nWe understand many Americans don't succeed because the family that should be there to guide them and serve as the first rung on the ladder of success isn't there or is badly broken.\nThe fact is that marriage is disappearing in places where government dependency is the highest. Most single mothers are doing heroic work and an amazing job raising their children. (Cheers, applause.) But if America is going to succeed, we must stop the assault on marriage and the family in America today. (Cheers, applause.) From lowering taxes to reforming social programs, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are dedicated to restoring the home where married moms and dads are pillars of strong communities, raising good citizens in our neighborhoods. (Cheers, applause.)\nA solid education should be the second rung on the ladder to success, but the system is failing. President Obama's solution has been to deny parents choice, attack private schools, and nationalize curriculum and student loans. Mitt Romney believes that parents and local community must be in charge of our schools, not the Department of Education. (Cheers, applause.)\nYet we all know there is one key to success that has helped people overcome even the greatest of obstacles: hard work. That's why work was the centerpiece of the bipartisan welfare law.\n(Scattered applause.) Requiring work as a condition for receiving welfare succeeded, and not just because the welfare rolls were cut in half but because employment went up, poverty went down and dreams were realized. It's a sturdy ladder of success that is built with healthy families, education and hard work. (Applause.)\nBut President Obama's policies undermine the traditional family, weaken the education system. And this summer he showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare. Now, I helped write the welfare reform bill. We made the law crystal clear. No president can waive the work requirement.\nBut as with his refusal to enforce our immigration laws, President Obama rules like he is above the law. (Applause.) Americans, take heed. When a president can simply give a speech or write a memo and change the law to do what the law says he cannot do, we will no longer be a republic. (Cheers, applause.)\nYet as my family and I crisscrossed America, something became so obvious to us: America is still the greatest country in the world, and with God's help and good leadership, we can restore the American dream.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nWhy? Because I held its hand. I shook the hand of the American dream. And it has a strong grip.\nI shook the hands of farmers and ranchers who made America the bread basket of the world 鈥斅爃ands weathered and worn, and proud of it.\nI grasped the dirty hands with scars that come from years of labor in the oil and gas fields, mines and mills 鈥斅爃ands that power and build America and are stewards of the abundant resources that God has given us.\nI've gripped hands that work in restaurants and hotels, hospitals, banks and grocery stores 鈥斅爃ands that serve and care for all of us.\nI clasped hands of men and women in uniform, and their families 鈥斅爃ands that sacrifice and risk all to protect and keep us free, and hands that pray for their safe return home. (Cheers, applause.)\nI held hands that are in want, hands looking for the dignity of a good job, hands growing weary of not finding one, but refusing to give up hope.\nAnd finally, I cradled the hands, the little broken hands, of the disabled; hands that struggle; hands that bring pain; hands that ennoble us and bring great joy.\nThey came to see us. Oh, did they come to see us when they found out that Karen and I were blessed with caring for someone special too, our Bella. (Applause.) Four and a half years ago I stood over a hospital isolette, staring at the tiny hands of our newborn daughter, who we hoped was perfectly healthy. But Bella's hands were just a little different, and I knew different wasn't good news.\nThe doctors later told us that Bella 鈥斅爐hat Bella was incompatible with life and to prepare to let go. They said even if she did survive, her disabilities would be so severe that Bella would not have a life worth living.\nWe didn't let go. (Cheers, applause.) Today Bella is full of life, and she has made our lives and countless others' much more worth living. (Cheers, applause.)\nI thank God that America still has one party that reaches out their hands in love to lift up all of God's children, born and unborn. (Cheers, applause.) And we say 鈥斅燼nd we say that each of us has dignity, and all of us have the right to live the American dream. (Applause.) And we also say that without you 鈥斅爓ithout you, America is not keeping faith with its dream that all men, all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. (Cheers, applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, you know we are stewards of a great inheritance. In November, we have a chance to vote for life and liberty, not dependency. A vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will put our country back in the hands of leaders who understand what America can and for the sake of our children must be to keep the dream alive.\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nBRIAN SANDOVAL: Thank you. Thank you.\nI stand here tonight humbled to share with you the story of a nation, a state and of one man. It is the story of America itself, of courageous, freedom-loving visionaries who believed in the promise of opportunity, rather than the divine right of kings; who dared to dream that anyone could rise above the circumstances of their birth.\nIt is also the story of the great Silver State, \"Battle Born\" Nevada. We joined the Union to help keep Abraham Lincoln in the White House and fulfill the promise of opportunity as he ended forever the scourge of slavery.\nAnd it is my story, the child of working-class Hispanic Americans, who has lived the American dream. The Proverbs tell us: From small beginnings come great things.\nMy father was one of 10 children. My mother and her family lived in a tiny two-bedroom house in the Southwest. Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.\nWhen I was a boy, my parents brought us to Nevada in search of opportunity. My first job was cleaning sheep pens. In college I worked in a hospital cafeteria. I worked my way through law school. Encouraged by my parents' love for this country, I dreamed of public service. I became a state legislator, a gaming regulator and attorney general of my state. My story could end there, but this is America. And so, in 2005, a simple son of promise was appointed by President Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate as a federal judge. (Cheers, applause.)\nI saw in my courtroom the fulfillment of all that our forefathers sought to create: a nation of laws, a nation of due process and merit, and justice for all 鈥斅燼nd, yes, a nation of immigrants. One of the greatest duties I performed was to administer the oath of citizenship to new Americans, immigrants who embody our dream of opportunity and prosperity.\nBut from the federal bench, I also saw a nation beset on all sides by unprecedented challenges. I watched my state's economy falter, stagnate and slide into decline.\nNevadans lost their jobs and their homes. Nevada was hit hardest by the recession, highest unemployment, highest foreclosure rate, highest bankruptcy rate.\nSo like so many, I looked around for help. And what did I find? A president who promised change but turned instead to the same tired strategy of ever-larger government, a president who abandoned hope and embraced only blame. So I stepped down from a lifetime appointment to make a difference.\nI ran for governor, was elected. And like Republicans all across this nation, I chose to make the tough decisions on issues like economic development, education reform and redesigning how state government operates, on job creation and reducing state spending and eliminating red tape. It hasn't been easy, and we're not through it yet. But I put my faith in the people of my great state because they are the ones who will grow our economy. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, I've seen Hispanic business owners and families from backgrounds not unlike my own struggle in this economy. I have seen young children from all walks of life begin to wonder if their future holds any hope at all. Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery. (Cheers, applause.) Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence.\nFrom personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine.\nMORE PAGE 4 08/28/2002 .STX fetime appointment to make a difference.\nI ran for governor, was elected.

Send Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, this administration sings a siren song that this is all there is. They tell us government is the answer, but we know it's the problem. They tell us we didn't build our businesses, that someone else made it happen. They tell us not to dream, but to settle.\nYou and I know America is better than that. Our national story is one of confronting challenges and winning. We have overcome economic devastation, defeated mighty oppressors and lifted up generation after generation of Americans. We can and we will do it again, for that is our birthright as members of the American family, white, black, Hispanic, Asian, immigrant or descendant of the founding fathers themselves. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe must leave Tampa this week on a mission to remind Americans they deserve more than the status quo. They deserve to dream big. We must remind Americans that the promise of opportunity remains unbroken, that every person in this great nation can succeed through hard work, courage and personal responsibility, for that is the real American story.\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd now I have the privilege of introducing to you one of those Hispanic business owners that I mentioned are struggling in this economy: Mr. Phil Archuletta of the great state of New Mexico. (Cheers, applause.)\nPHIL ARCHULETTA: Thank you, Governor, and thank you, Tampa! (Cheers, applause.) My story is a story of many Americans, just like Governor Sandoval's. From humble beginnings, I built a successful business. But today my business is at risk because of the Obama administration. For 40 years my company built road signs on the Forest Service road system. In fact, in 1984 I was fortunate to receive the national award from President Reagan for being the most successful minority business in the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn 2004, President Bush made it possible for our company to manufacture all the signs for federal agencies. When President Obama came on board, he pushed a stimulus. I believed that my business was going to explode with work. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.\nThe Democrats' Congress and the Obama administration created a new procurement process that harms existing small-business contracts, which devastated my business.\nI pleaded for my congressman and senators, all Democrats, and meetings were arranged with the Forest Service. They all listened carefully. They made promises, but nothing ever happened. Today, I'm barely hanging on with orders from the state of New Mexico, thanks to Governor Susana Martinez 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼nd the orders that are coming through the Forest Service from very loyal customers. I have heard the same story from other small businesses all over the country.\nPresident Obama talks like he supports small businesses, but his actions are destroying us. His administration is putting us out of business. It is our turn to put them out of office. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nSCOTT WALKER: Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you, and good evening. (Cheers, applause.)\nOn June 5th, voters in Wisconsin were asked to choose between going backwards to the days of double-digit tax increases, billion- dollar budget deficits and record job loss, or moving forward with reforms that lowered the tax burden, balanced the budget and helped small businesses create more jobs. On June 5th, voters in my swing state were asked to decide if they wanted elected officials who measure success by how many people are dependent on the government, or if they wanted leaders who believe success is measured by how many people are not dependent on the government because they control their own destiny in the private sector. (Applause.) On June 5th, voters in Wisconsin got to determine who was in charge: was is the big- government special interests in Washington, or the hardworking taxpayers of our state? The good news is that on June 5th, the hardworking taxpayers won. (Cheers, applause.)\nJust ask Sandy Breth why that's important. When the economy took a dive a few years ago, she took a pay cut. Not long after that, she lost her job. Today, however, she's working at G3 industries in Mosinee, Wisconsin. In fact, she just received a promotion.\nG3 is one of those companies that added jobs during the past year and now has plans to add even more. The owner told me that he's creating additional jobs in Wisconsin because he likes the way we're moving our state forward, and he's even more committed since the last election. Without our positive changes, he told me, he would not have had the confidence to grow business in Wisconsin.\nImproving the business climate is not only good for small- business owners, it's good for people like Sandy and her family. We need more stories like hers in America because the last couple of years have been, well, pretty tough. Like many places across the country, Wisconsin lost more than a hundred thousand jobs from 2008 to 2010. Unemployment during that time topped out at over 9 percent. But because of our reforms, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs, and our unemployment rate is down from when I first took office.\nEqually as important, we improved the economic climate for job creators. Today 94 percent of our employers believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction. (Cheers, applause.) That compares to just 10 percent who thought the same thing just two years ago. Elections have consequences.\nAs was the case in Wisconsin two years ago, too many Americans think our country is headed in the wrong direction. But Mitt Romney understands, like I understand, that people 鈥斅爌eople, not governments, create jobs. With that in mind, my administration is making it easier for people to create jobs in Wisconsin. Our reforms put the hardworking taxpayers back in charge, people like Sandy Breth.\nSadly, the federal government seems to be going in the opposite direction. Nationally, we've experienced 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent.\nLast month 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate. More than 12 million of our fellow citizens are unemployed.\nWe need someone to turn things around in America. That leader is Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney turned businesses around in the private sector, he saved the Winter Olympics and he balanced state budgets without raising taxes in a way that helped the private sector create more jobs. Then, with the announcement of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Governor Romney not only showed that he has the experience and the skill to become president, he showed he has the courage and the passion to be an exceptional president. (Cheers, applause.)\nWith this pick, he showed that the \"R\" next to his name doesn't just stand for \"Republican,\" it stands for \"reformer.\" Now more than ever, we need reformers, leaders who think more about the next generation than just the next election. (Applause.) That's what you get. That's what you get from Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nNow, in a few weeks, we will celebrate the 225th anniversary of our federal Constitution. Moments like that remind us that what makes America so great, what makes us exceptional, is that throughout our history, in moments of crisis, be they economic or fiscal, military or spiritual, what makes America amazing has been that there have always been men and women of courage who think more about the future of their children and their grandchildren than they did about their own political careers.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nLet this be one of those moments. Let this be our time in history, so that some day 鈥斅爏ome day we can tell our children and our grandchildren that we were there, that we changed the course of history for the better. Let us tell them that we helped elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to save America.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nBOB MCDONNELL: Thank you. Thank you very much. Good evening, my fellow Republicans. Are you ready to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in 70 days? (Cheers, applause.)\nImagine that: We'll have a president who actually knows how to create jobs and a vice president who actually knows what state he's in. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nNow, I don't have to tell any of you this is a tough economy. We all have friends and family and neighbors who've lost their jobs and their homes. Worse, they've lost their hope. And their lost hope is why we need a big change this November. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis election is about restoring the American dream. That dream led my grandfather, a poor farm boy, to leave Ireland a hundred years ago and come to Ellis Island to begin his journey of freedom in America. My grandfather could have never guessed that his son would fight for this nation in World War II, that his great-granddaughter would lead a platoon in Iraq and his grandson would grow up a middle- class kid in Fairfax County, serve in the Army and now hold the same job as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. What an incredible country we call home here in the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nThis nation is powered and defined by the great idea of the American dream. That's an idea that says if you work hard, if you dream big, if you follow the rules and pursue opportunity, the sky is the limit in the United States of America. We cannot lose that dream. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, unfortunately, many Americans are now hurting very badly. Too many Americans are looking for work because this president's policies simply haven't worked. Washington today has a surplus of rhetoric and a deficit of leadership and results.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nAnd you know the problems: unemployment over 8 percent for 42 straight months; the national debt, immoral, at $16 trillion and growing; new business startups at the lowest level in 30 years. And now the EPA is the \"Employment Prevention Agency.\" (Laughter, applause.)\nThese times call for new leadership to get this great country out of debt and back to work. And the choice is very clear: the status quo of the entitlement society versus a dynamic change to an opportunity society. That's what we need in America. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need a president who will say to a small businesswoman: Congratulations, we applaud your success. You did make that happen. You did build that in America! (Cheers, applause.)\nBig government didn't build America. You built America. Small businesses don't come out of Washington, D.C., pre-made on flatbed trucks. That coffee shop in Henrico County, that florist in Virginia Beach, that bakery in Radford, Virginia 鈥斅爐hey were all built by American entrepreneurs with big dreams, not a big-spending government with a wide-open wallet full of other people's money.\nIt is remarkable, in 236 years of the American experiment, what the ingenious people of this magnificent nation can do when they're given the opportunity. Every American deserves the opportunity of a limited, responsible government that performs its core functions well and then gets the heck out of the way.\nThat's when good things happen in the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nLook at the results of Republican policies in the states. In states with Republican governors, the average unemployment rate is a full point lower than in states with Democratic governors. It makes a difference. (Cheers, applause.) Republican governors lead seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates. And 12 of the 15 states that have been ranked best for business have Republican governors. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhile the Obama administration borrows now $3 billion a day just to keep the lights on, Republican governors have closed $65 billion in budget shortfalls 鈥斅爓ithout raising taxes. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn Virginia over the last two years, with Republicans and Democrats working together, our unemployment rate is down 20 percent to 5.9 percent. We've added 151,000 net new jobs in Virginia. We've had nearly $1.4 billion in budget surpluses, and we've done it by keeping regulation and litigation to a minimum, and we haven't raised taxes. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo my friends, while the president talks, Republican governors lead. Talk is cheap: Results matter. (Cheers.) Conservative fiscal policies are working, and so are more Americans in the states with Republican governors today. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, just think what we could do if we had a president who would support us and not obstruct us, someone who has created jobs in the private sector, who understands the economy and who has actually balanced a budget 鈥斅爃eck, for that matter, somebody who's actually passed a budget. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need President Mitt Romney 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燽ecause I can tell you when Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan get together and they work with Susana Martinez, or Scott Walker, or John Kasich, or Terry Branstad, and governors from both parties across the country, we will get people back to work in this country. (Applause.) Our great country can no longer afford the job-destroying policies coming out of Washington, D.C.\nBut we don't just have to hope for change; we can make the change this November. We will lift up and grow the middle class. We will celebrate job creators again. We will restore that great American dream that led my grandfather here from Ireland a hundred years ago. (Applause.) And that all starts with electing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan this November. Thank you very much. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce one of those hardworking job creators that I was just talking about.\nBev Gray is president and CEO of Exhibit Edge in Chantilly, Virginia. Exhibit Edge designs, produces and manages trade show exhibits for small and large businesses and nonprofits. Mrs. Gray and her husband, Mike, who's vice president of the company, employ 20 Virginians. And this year they celebrate 20 years of success in business. And here's the thing about Bev: When she talks about her business, yes, she built that business.\nPlease welcome Bev Gray. (Cheers, applause.)\nBEV GRAY: Thank you 鈥斅爐hank you, Governor.\nImagine working every day for four years without a paycheck. I did. I worked while our children, Jessica (sp) and Kevin, played and napped. And after I tucked them into bed, I worked. Our first nine months we had one client 鈥斅燼 client who waited six months to pay us.\nWe sustained our business by (cashing ?) into our personal credit cards and borrowing against our home. The commitments, expenses and the stress kept us up at night, but we were determined to build a successful business. And after several years of hard work, long hours, no pay and low pay, we did. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\nToday, Exhibit Edge employs 20 people and helps businesses grow through trade show marketing. When those businesses grow, they employ people. The president said that business owners didn't get there on their own.\nWell, he's wrong. We risked 鈥斅�(applause) 鈥斅爐hank you 鈥斅爓e risked everything and succeeded because of our hard work and commitment.\nWhat President Obama doesn't understand is that when businesses grow, unemployment goes down and people thrive. (Cheers, applause.) We need a president who understands the value of entrepreneurship. Governor Romney knows and, more importantly, appreciates what it takes to build a successful business. And that's why I'm supporting Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nMARY FALLIN: (Inaudible) 鈥斅爐here. Thank you.\nPresident Reagan once said, \"There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination and wonder.\" He believed, like I believe, like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan believe, that the potential for America is limitless. We can and we will overcome any economic challenge if 鈥斅燼nd listen to this 鈥斅爄f the federal government gets out of the way and if it lets go of the regulatory chokehold that's zapping the air out of our economy.\nAnd it's deflating the spirits of our entrepreneurs. We need a president who will applaud and encourage those who work hard to pursue their dreams, to reach their potential, and in doing so, make themselves and America better and stronger. And that man is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe history of the state of Oklahoma offers a great example of pursuing the American dream. It was built and settled by pioneers moving west to seek better lives. During the great land run of 1889, thousands of families rushed up and put a stake down on empty plots of land. They built tent cities overnight. They farmed the land. They worked very hard.\nAnd in 1897, eight years after the land run, a handful of very adventuresome pioneers 鈥斅爓ith their own money 鈥斅燼nd listen, it wasn't the federal government's money 鈥斅爊o! 鈥斅爐hey risked their own money to drill Oklahoma's first oil well, the Nellie Johnstone. And by doing so, these early-day pioneers changed the future and the fortune of Oklahoma forever. And today, Oklahoma is one of the nation's key energy producers and job creators, with an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, President Obama, he wants us to believe that Oklahomans owe that success to the federal government, to the Department of Energy or the EPA or the IRS or maybe even him. Well, Mr. President, we know better. And as in Oklahoma we say: That dog won't hunt.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nWe owe these remarkable successes to the imagination and the ingenuity of people like my friend, Oklahoman Harold Hamm. (Cheers.) He is the son of sharecroppers and the youngest of 13 children. Harold grew up in a small town of Lexington, Oklahoma. And as a child, he helped out on the farm, and he went to school only after the first freeze or Christmas, whichever came first. And while attending high school, he worked for a dollar an hour at a gas station. After school, Harold took a job cleaning out oil barrels. And guess what, at the age of 20, he bought his own truck, and he began a one-man oilfield service business. He made enough money to begin taking college-level courses in geology and mineralogy. And at the age of 26, he drilled a wildcat well that produced 75 barrels of oil an hour. And in Oklahoma, we call that a gusher. (Scattered cheers, applause.)\nToday Harold Hamm is the chairman and the CEO of Oklahoma's own Continental Resources 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅燼 top 10 U.S. producer of petroleum liquids. And he's got nearly 700 employees operating in 10 states and valued at over $13 billion. (Cheers, applause.) Now Harold and his company are helping to power cars and homes and businesses all across the nation. Harold and other energy entrepreneurs have completely transformed the U.S. energy's (sic) outlook. And with a President Romney, we'll end America's dependence on foreign oil. (Cheers, applause.) And most importantly, we're going to create even more American jobs.\nHarold's success story is not a one of a kind. It's the American dream, and it has been realized by countless men and women since the very founding of this country. He is just one of the many visionaries and innovators in the private sector that are the true drivers of economic growth and creation.\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that's what President Obama just doesn't get. He'll tell you if you've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen. Well, Mr. President, like who? You think it's the IRS, the EPA or the federal government? Gosh. The president believes that government is responsible for our successes, and that's why his solution to everything is more government, bigger spending, more regulation, more bureaucratic programs like \"Obamacare.\"\nAnd he says his plans are working, but look at the results: 42 months of unemployment, over 8 percent; 23 million Americans out of work, underemployed or even just not even looking for work anymore; a nation that is threatened by nearly $16 trillion of debt; and families that are feeling pinched, not just by a bad economy, but by a president that promised hope and change, and left many Americans with no hope and just change in their pockets. President Obama believes that the power of big government is the key to American success.\nBut let me tell you, Mitt Romney believes in the power of the people. (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney understands that it's free enterprise and hard work, not the government, that has made the United States the envy of the world.\nAnd by the way, the selection of Wisconsin 鈥斅燩aul Ryan to be his running mate 鈥斅�(cheers) 鈥斅爄s an excellent choice. There are many reasons that he'll make a great vice president, not the least to mention is that his wife is from Madill, Oklahoma. (Cheers, applause.) And of course he has two dogs that are named Boomer and Sooner, after the Oklahomans in the land run. (Chuckles.)\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, the Romney-Ryan team will reverse the tide of decline and promote economic security. They know that it's hardworking American families, not the federal bureaucracy, that has built our great and glorious nation. Mitt Romney is ready to lead. He has the experience. He has the vision. And we will restore America's economy and its greatness. (Cheers, applause.)\nI am proud to support his candidacy for president, and as the next leader of the free world, Mitt Romney will make us all very proud.\nGod bless you, and thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nJOHN KASICH: Thank you. Thank you. You know 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爕ou know, I don't know about you 鈥斅營 don't know about you, but I've got a feeling 鈥斅爕ou know, I've got a feeling 鈥斅燼nd it's (just ?) because I don't like The Black Eyed Peas 鈥斅營 got a feeling that we're about to elect a new president of the United States of America! (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd let me tell you why it matters, because it really matters. We need a president who will restore the strength and the power of the American people so we the people can rebuild our economy and so we the people can rebuild the United States of America, plain and simple. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, we've made real progress in Ohio in restoring confidence, because that's what so much of life is about. And we are setting people free in order to build success. But we need a new partner in Washington. This relationship is just not working. It is holding us back.\nI'm going to tell you our story. I'm going to tell you the story of Ohio and the story of lessons learned. I took office in 2011, and when I came into office, we were 48th in the nation in job creation, 48th. We had an $8 billion budget deficit, the largest in the history of the great state of Ohio, and we had 89 cents in our rainy day fund. Most toddlers have more than 89 cents in their little piggy banks, let alone what was in our treasury. Our credit rating was headed down the drain. And we were 鈥斅爓e had suffered a loss of 400,000 jobs. And ladies and gentlemen, tonight the greatest moral issue in America today is job creation. We had lost 400,000 jobs, our people were hurting and our families were hurting as a result of the recession. In Ohio, we were following a policy of tax, spend and duck, and that's too much of what politicians do.\nThey want to avoid the tough issues.\nBut when we came into power, with my colleagues in the legislature, we took our problems head-on. We balanced our budget. That $8 billion deficit was eliminated without a tax increase in the state of Ohio. (Cheers, applause.) And we could not raise taxes because we were not competitive.\nSo you know how we did it? We did it the way that a family does it. We sat down and set priorities. We eliminated those programs that we no longer needed. And you know, when government people spend our money, they're very wasteful about it. So we went through it and eliminated those things we didn't need, but we prioritized those things that we really did need.\nAnd I'll give you an example. We allowed Mom and Dad to stay in their own homes if able instead of going into a nursing home where the costs were five times as high, and when they're in their own home, they're healthier and happier and, frankly, more independent. And that saved us a lot of money because we made government work better. And that made a heck of a lot of sense for us.\nWe also cut taxes because Ohio needed to be competitive. We were 8 billion (dollars) in the hole. We balanced the budget, but we cut our taxes. And we cut the income tax. (Cheers, applause.) And the reason we cut it is so that Ohio could be competitive.\nAnd at the same time, we killed the death tax. We killed the death tax. (Cheers, applause.) And we killed that death tax because no person should have to visit the undertaker and the tax man on the same day. And small businesses and farmers should be able to pass on their hard work to the next generation. (Cheers, applause.) And we need to do it in Washington as well. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd we restored common sense in our regulations. And you know what? We still protect the environment, we protect our families, but we don't over-regulate and kill the job creators in our state. In fact, we want to honor the job creators in our state and work with them because they help our families.\nNow, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, just like what Mitt Romney's going to face, the actions that we took were not always easy, and the actions that we took were not always popular. But you know what? When you get yourself in public service, you must lead and you must do what is necessary.\nAnd I want to tell you the good news of where we are today. I told you a minute ago that when we came into office, we were 48th in job creation. You know where we are today? We're fourth in America in job creation and number one in the Midwest! (Cheers, applause.)\nWe went from 89 cents in our rainy day fund to $500 million in surplus 鈥斅燼 half a billion dollars in surplus 鈥斅爁rom being in the hole. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd you know, I watched in horror as we saw the Italians and the French and the Spanish and the Greeks have their credit downgrade. And I remember the night I watched America's credit go downgraded. But in Ohio, instead of our credit going down the drain, our credit outlook has been improved because it's been recognized that we are managing our finances and creating jobs. (Cheers, applause.)\nBut ladies and gentlemen, when over those last four years we had lost 400,000 jobs, in Ohio today we have grown new jobs by 122,000 鈥斅�122,000 families better off.\nBut you know what? The wind is in our face. The president has given us headwinds. President Obama has doubled the national debt. You know, I was the chairman of the Budget Committee when we balanced the budget in '97, and I look with horror up at that clock that shows $15 trillion in the national debt. That's the sword of Damocles hanging over our children's head. And the president is doing nothing about it. In fact, each year he's increasing that by $1 trillion 鈥斅�$1 trillion. (Boos.)\nAnd let me also tell you that the president says his answer to these problems lie in this: more taxes. Let's take more money out of the pockets of the American people and send it to, of all places, Washington, D.C. Can you even believe it? We not only need to balance budgets, we need to cut taxes, not raise them, to get on the right track. And his regulations have had a smothering effect on businesses, and it has paralyzed the job creators.\nFolks, this is the wrong philosophy, these are the wrong policies, and we need a new leader. And that is exactly why I am for Mitt Romney for president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, I want to tell you about Mitt. He's a business leader. If there is anything we need in government today, it's people who understand how to create jobs, plain and simple. And the people that criticize folks in business just simply don't get it. They've put in this hole. And Mitt Romney has a history being a great job creator.\nSecondly, he was a great governor. He went from billions of dollars in the hole when he became governor to billions of dollars in surplus when he left, and he went from the loss of tens of thousands of jobs when he became governor to the creation of 40,000 new jobs when he left office. And he did it in \"Taxachusetts\" of all places, OK?\n(Cheers, applause.)\nAnd remember this: beyond his work in business and beyond his work in government, he's a natural leader. He took those Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, and took them when they were in peril and headed down the drain, he fixed the Olympics and made every American proud of what he did in Salt Lake City, and built a shinier and brighter America as a result. (Cheers, applause.)\nFolks, I want to tell you this: Joe Biden disputes a lot of those facts, but Joe Biden told me that he was a good golfer, and I've played golf with Joe Biden; I can tell you that's not true, as well as all the other things that he says. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nFolks, for the good of our kids 鈥斅營 know we're at a Republican convention, but this is not about Republican and Democrat; this is about somebody that's going to get this country moving again, restore the strength of this country, energize the people, set them free in a free-enterprise system. That's what this is all about. It is about our children. It is about our families. It is about our country. And frankly, ladies and gentlemen, it's about the world, because even though they don't want to admit it, they depend on the United States of America to lead and to bring moral purpose to the globe.\nLadies and gentlemen, we got to leave here and march and get to everybody to make sure that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are president and vice president of the United States. Thank you all very much. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "KELLY AYOTTE: \"Live Free or Die.\" (Cheers, applause.) That's the motto of the great state of New Hampshire. But I believe tonight we all share that view, as have generations of Americans before us.\nLike most Americans, our life changed after 9/11. My husband, Joe, who was on track to be a commercial pilot, instead served our great country flying combat missions in Iraq. (Cheers, applause.) And when Joe returned home from the war, he found himself in the same position as so many Americans. He needed a job.\nSo he started a family business 鈥斅燼 landscaping and snowplowing company. And when I say \"he,\" I mean \"we,\" because I spent many a sleepless night shoveling snow. And I'm proud of the fact that in addition to being a United States senator, I'm also pretty good with a snowplow. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are no different from those families who take risks starting their own business. We borrowed money to pursue our dreams, and believe me, there was no guarantee of success.\nWe were certainly not \"too big to fail.\" We had to make it work.\nYet through all the hard work and sacrifice, we pulled together as a family. And as the business grew, so did our extended family.\nAnd I speak to you tonight with great concern for our employees, their families, my family and your family. My concern is that President Obama is making very difficult for small businesses to get started, to create jobs and to survive. (Applause.)\nYou know what I hear all the time from small-business owners that I speak with? They want to focus on their business; the Obama administration wants to bury them with rules, regulations and red tape. (Boos.) From the National Labor Relations Board to the Department of Labor to the EPA, under this administration, the regulations are up and the job creation is down. (Applause.)\nPresident Obama's view is clear. He actually believes that as a small business grows, the federal government should take a larger and larger share of its earnings. That's punishment for expanding and creating more jobs. I call it a success tax. (Applause.)\nAnd, you know, the very best example is \"Obamacare.\" And let me tell you what I hear in the real world about \"Obamacare.\" Just a couple of months ago, a successful restaurant owner in Concord, New Hampshire, told me about his dilemma. He wanted to open up a second restaurant and hire more employees. But you know what? He realized that if he did, he would trigger penalties under \"Obamacare,\" and he couldn't afford it, so he never opened up that restaurant. Is that what we want for small businesses in America?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nKELLY AYOTTE: No. To be afraid to grow because of the government? To face penalties when you create more jobs?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nKELLY AYOTTE: To be told you're earning too much?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nKELLY AYOTTE: Isn't it time that we had a leader who believes that creating jobs ought to be celebrated, not penalized? (Cheers, applause.)\nThat is why Mitt Romney is running for president. (Cheers, applause.) He'll get the federal government out of the business of small business. (Cheers, applause.) He'll fight to lower and simplify taxes. He'll work to eliminate job-killing red tape. And he will roll back \"Obamacare\" starting on day one. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn both the private sector, and as governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney always asked: How can I help small businesses grow, innovate and compete? It's the right question, and it's the question that this administration never thinks to ask.\nBut why should we be surprised? President Obama has never even run a lemonade stand. (Cheers, applause.) And you know what? It shows. (Continued applause.)\nFor the sake of the future of small business, we need to replace Barack Obama with Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.) We need to replace Barack Obama with Mitt Romney because Mitt truly gets it. Mitt understands the hopes and dreams of small-business owners throughout our great country.\nBut don't just take my word for it. I want you to hear from someone who is directly on the front lines of small business.\nJack Gilchrist is a small-business owner from Hudson, New Hampshire. Three generations of his family have used their own hands to build Gilchrist Metal Fabricating. It's a true family business, founded over thirty years ago by Jack's father and carried on by Jack and his son. Jack Gilchrist is the face of small business in America.\nAnd yes, he did build it. (Cheers, applause.) Please join me in welcoming my friend Jack Gilchrist. (Cheers, applause.)\nJACK GILCHRIST: Thank you very much, Senator Ayotte. Boy, am I glad to have you as a champion of small business for New Hampshire. (Cheers, applause.)\nGovernor Sununu.\nLike many small-business men, my dad borrowed against our house to purchase the machinery to start Gilchrist Metal Fabricating, machines making equipment for drilling oil, generating power, television broadcasting, processing food and many other industries which touch our lives every day, machines run by taxpaying Americans like us. (Cheers, applause.) We employ about 40 people, most with families, including my son Stewart (sp).\nThough we have enjoyed success, we face more global pressure every day. So do our suppliers. So do our customers. If we don't continually streamline our processes to stay efficient, we will lose out to our competition. We don't have a choice. We often make decisions that are difficult. Running a business means taking responsibility, presenting a future to the management team, developing a functional budget, ensuring that we have adequate supplies and making a commitment to fulfill our customers' orders on time.\nSure, there are things which I cannot control, but running the business is my job and mine alone. I blame no one else for the challenges we face.\nI'm often reminded of something Lee Iacocca said. Lead, follow or get out of the way. (Cheers, applause.)\nEveryone who runs a business understands this 鈥斅爀veryone but our federal government. They won't lead, their rules and regulations are too hard to follow, and they won't get out of our way. This administration is killing us out there.\nSmall business needs a leader, a leader who understands the entire spectrum of business and industry, a leader who can work with all parties involved, a leader who will not avoid dealing with difficult issues, a leader with experience to understand what it takes, a leader who is in touch with America's small businesses.\nMitt Romney is exactly that leader. Help us elect Mitt Romney for president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nCATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Cathy McMorris Rodgers and I'm proud to represent eastern Washington in Congress. (Cheers, applause.)\nTonight we're going to do things a little differently. I have the pleasure of serving as your host for the evening, guiding you through the next few hours. And I'm delighted to report we have a wonderful lineup for you. Each speaker will be joining together to send a message to President Obama, and that message is three simple words: We built it. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE: We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it!\nCATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS: Before 鈥斅燽efore I ran for Congress, I worked in my family's business, the Peachcrest Fruit Basket, for 13 years. I worked hard every day, and I can assure you that my family built that business from the ground up. (Cheers, applause.)\nToday that hands-on experience guides my decision-making in Congress. Unlike President Obama, I know that small businesses are the true engine of our economy, not big government.\n(Cheers, applause.) And what businesses need to grow and create jobs is less taxes and less regulation, not more. (Cheers, applause.)\nTonight you'll hear a variety of stories from people who work hard every day to build our economy. You'll hear from Jack Gilchrist, the owner of a family-owned metal fabricating business in New Hampshire. A number of our leading nation's governors are with us tonight, the chief executives from states like Ohio 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅�(chuckles) 鈥斅燱isconsin 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燨klahoma 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燬outh Carolina 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燦evada 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼nd Virginia 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爌laces where they have created an environment that unleashes American ingenuity instead of stifling it. They will tell us how their job creators in their communities aren't found in the statehouse; they're found on Main Street. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd one of the speakers I'm most looking forward to hearing from tonight is someone who I think we can all agree will make a fabulous first lady, Ann Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nTo close out the evening, we will hear from a dynamic and engaging leader who's really shaking up the way they do business in New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie. (Cheers, applause.)\nSo let's get started. Our next speaker is from the Granite State and was elected to the United States Senate in 2010. (Cheers, applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Kelly Ayotte. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "SHER VALENZUELA: Good evening. My name is Sher Valenzuela. Two years ago, I would never have imagined that I would be here with you tonight speaking at the Republican National Convention. I've seen these on TV. What an honor to be with you tonight. (Cheers, applause.)\nI'm a mother from Delaware, a co-owner with my husband of First State Manufacturing. And after this November, I plan on taking on a new title: the next lieutenant governor of the great state of Delaware. (Cheers, applause.)\nTonight it is my honor to talk about the three themes that inspired me to run for office: my family, the business we built and my belief in America's unlimited potential.\nBut it starts with a wonderful story. Shortly after our son was born, my husband and I received some news that would change our lives forever. We learned that our son Simon was autistic. We loved him with every fiber of our being, but the experts told us not to expect much. Your son will never learn to read, write or communicate effectively, they said. Accept these limitations, they seemed to say.\nIt was a tough time. We realized quickly that the paychecks from our jobs wouldn't pay for the professionals that Simon needed to overcome the odds. So we followed a deep and long-standing American tradition: We took a risk, we bet on the future, and we started our own business. (Cheers, applause.)\nWhen serving in the Army, my husband had taken a mail-order course on upholstery. One day I came home to find him pulling out the secondhand sewing machine he'd learned his craft on. He called her \"Old Betsy.\" A second-generation Mexican-American, my husband will do whatever it takes to provide for his family. (Applause.)\nOur friends thought we were crazy. Didn't we have enough challenges trying to raise Simon? Why not just accept our lot in life? That's when I remembered something my dad used to say.\nMy dad was an old-school guy, a former drill sergeant, blue-collar worker his whole life. He taught us to work hard but think big. I remember he once pulled off the road and pointed to a big factory. That's more than a building, he told me. It took a lot of work to get that big, but it all started out as an idea around someone's kitchen table.\nI guess you could say our upholstery business was our kitchen table idea. Fifteen years later, we employ more than 70 people in our 70,000 square foot factory. (Cheers, applause.) And we're so proud of what we do. We make umpire vests for Little Leagues, products for the men and women that serve our country, restaurant seats for pizza chains and protective gear for our allies in the Israeli military. (Cheers, applause.) We're actually taking work away from Chinese and Mexican competitors and bringing it back to Delaware. (Cheers, applause.)\nHow did it happen? We defied the odds. We rolled the dice on losing or gaining everything. We didn't listen to the experts. We grew our dream.\nAnd with our son Simon, we didn't listen to the experts either. Yes, he still struggles with autism, but this past June, he completed his first year at the University of Delaware. (Applause.)\nI can't tell you how much this means to him and how much it means to me, the mom of a special needs child. (Cheers, applause.)\nRaising our family and building our business have been the twin passions of our lives. But what struck me is how similar they are. If you've ever raised a child or you started a business, you know what I'm talking about. You put your heart and soul into it. You work to find the 25th hour in the day. You struggle to overcome insurmountable odds. And you do it all because you believe in an unlimited future, an unlimited future. Isn't that what America is all about? (Cheers, applause.)\nBut today when I talk to the young families and the struggling businesses that I meet throughout Delaware, I have to ask: Are we creating an unlimited future for them?\nA Gallup report recently said that nearly 50 percent of small- business owners aren't hiring because of what they call regulatory uncertainty. Can you blame them?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!\nSHER VALENZUELA: This administration has imposed 106 new regulations, major regulations. They're on track to create 109 million new paperwork burden hours, and by year's end, $110 billion worth of new regulatory costs will be laid on the back of business owners and taxpayers. (Boos.) You might call that regulatory uncertainty.\nI call it an all-out assault on free enterprise. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat's what worries me about this administration. They seem to eager to fix society, but they don't have a clue about how to fix the economy. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn the end, it comes down to what you believe 鈥斅燼nd yes, they are believers. The Obama administration believes in experts and blue- ribbon panels. They believe in creating new agencies and boards. They believe in all that, but they just don't trust the entrepreneur's ability to grow her own business and to create jobs. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney not only believes in the values of economic freedom, his entire life has been committed to advancing it. Last April, I was privileged to be one of a dozen business leaders in Delaware to sit down and meet with Mitt Romney. This wasn't a scripted photo-op. It wasn't a staged event. This was a real discussion with someone who understands where small businesses are coming from. You see, Governor Romney, for him, it's not free enterprise 鈥斅爄t's not just a theory, free enterprise. It's not just something you study in graduate school. It's a creed. It's a commitment. It's a worldview. It's what connects Americans, families and communities to an unlimited future.\nThat's why this election is so important to small businesses and to our country. I represent the small businesses, the women, the families working so hard to rebuild our communities.\nIn order to secure our unlimited future, we need a leader who understands the moral case for free enterprise, someone 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爏omeone like Mitt Romney who believes in an unlimited future. These aren't just words to Mitt Romney. His track record proves it.\nLet's secure that future together by sending Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House in November. (Cheers, applause.) Dios lo bendiga. God bless America. Thank you. (Continued cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nJANINE TURNER: Wow! Look at our republic at work! (Cheers, applause.) Whoo!\nHello, fellow patriots! (Cheers, applause.) As an actress, I have worked on movie sets all over our great land, from New York 鈥斅爓here are you, New York? 鈥斅爓hoo, there you are! 鈥斅爐o Los Angeles 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爁rom Miami 鈥斅爓here are you, Miami? 鈥斅燜lorida, to Seattle!

(Laughs.) There you go.\nWhat I have witnessed is the splendor of American ingenuity, the triumph of American tenacity and the goodness of the American heart. And President Obama, I'm here to tell you 鈥斅爓hat am I going to say? The government didn't built it. (Cheers, applause.) Yeah. God and the American people built it. (Inaudible.) And while 鈥斅燼nd while we're at it, I stand here as witness to say America is exceptional. (Cheers, applause.) America's entrepreneurship was fostered by our Founding Fathers' vision of a republic, a small government limited by the Constitution's enumerated powers.\nSpeaking of our republic, when Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall after signing the Constitution, he walked out, and a woman approached him and said, sir, sir, what have you given us? And he said, a republic, ma'am, if you can keep it. Yeah. (Cheers, applause.)\nI believe the best way to keep our republican form of government is with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. (Cheers, applause.)\nOur Constitution guarantees us a republican form of government in Article IV, Section 4. But our liberal brethren, they don't feel constrained by our Constitution. That's convenient for them. By ignoring constitutional limits, they do whatever they like, don't they? Yes, like grow the government to unbelievable and unsustainable heights, and accumulate historic and catastrophic debt.\nPatrick Henry said, \"give me liberty, or give me death.\" (Applause.) Yes. But today Obama's 鈥斅燨bama enables an entitlement society that says give me liberty and gimme gimme. (Laughter, applause.) Why? Because Democrats depend on dependence.\nAmerica was not born with a gimme gimme mentality, and American liberty cannot survive with a gimme gimme mentality. America was built with her hands at work, not with her hands out. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe torch of American Dream is fueled with the unquenchable desire for independence, liberty and freedom. Free enterprise has paved the way for Americans to earn their own success, and it has created an America that has yielded an unprecedented level of progress. This progress has lifted up humanity to greater heights of living and a greater level of dignity.\nMitt Romney will preserve this exceptional American legacy. (Cheers, applause.)\nBarack Obama? Barack Obama will destroy it. Obama is stifling the American dream primarily because it isn't his dream. (Cheers, applause.) His dream 鈥斅爃is dream is not of an independent people. His dream is of a dependent people based upon the failed principles of antiquated government.\nMitt Romney will restore the American dream based on three of our tried and true founding principles. One, God gives us our rights, not government. (Cheers, applause.) Think about it. If man gives us our rights, then man can take them away. As James Madison forewarned and history has proven, men are not angels. Two, the checks and balances of government are paramount. Without them, we have tyranny, and tyranny strangles liberty. And three 鈥斅爕ou ready for this one? OK. This is what I believe. The genius of the people will prevail 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爁or the people's voice 鈥斅爐he people's voice is the republic. And for the republic, Mitt Romney will stand.\nGod bless America. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you very much. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "REINCE PRIEBUS: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the 2012 Republican National Convention. (Cheers, applause.) Once again, we thank the people at Tampa for their hospitality.\nTonight, we embark on a better future for every American! (Cheers, applause.) Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will lead us. Our timeless, tested Republican principles will light the way. Free enterprise, individual opportunity, limited government 鈥斅爐hey made America great. And only they can keep America strong.\nThe last four years under President Obama have been trying and troubling for this entire country.\nThe tired big-government policies of the past have failed us. We can't afford any more disappointments. We need a new direction. We need a new president. (Cheers.)\nI know 鈥斅營 know and you know just the man for the job. He's a family man. He's a businessman. He's spent his career building successful companies. And then he saved the Olympics in 2002 and brought pride to our nation. As governor, he balanced the budget, cut taxes and created jobs.\nThe president America needs is Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.) Governor Romney has a record of tremendous accomplishments, but he doesn't ask for accolades. He just asks, how can I help? That's the mark of a true leader, a humble focus on getting the job done.\nMitt Romney spent his life turning around failing enterprises, and America needs a turnaround. Specifically, we need Barack Obama to turn around and go back to Chicago! (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd guys, let me tell you about my friend Paul Ryan, a man of true integrity.\nHe doesn't descend into the gutter politics of the other side. He rises above it and charts a better path. He's my buddy, my congressman, and I can't wait to call him our next vice president! (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd hey, won't it be nice to have a second in command who can spend his days doing more than just prying his foot out of his mouth? (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\nPaul and Janna's three children are the lights of their lives. In Congress, Paul doesn't worry about his political future, he worries about the future of his children 鈥斅爄n the same way Sally and I worry about the future of our two kids, Jack and Grace. Their future is in jeopardy because President Obama has added $5 trillion to the national debt for all of our children to pay off. That's unacceptable. Our founders didn't declare our independence only to see us become dependent on the borrowed money of foreign nations.\nWe still have time to chart a better course. But if Barack Obama gets four more years, it might be too late. We're not just spending money; we're living on borrowed time. Look at the record of the outgoing administration: 23 million Americans struggling for work, 42 months of unemployment above 8 percent, the worst jobs record since the Great Depression.\nIt's time to elect Mitt Romney so we can get moving on the great America comeback. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, the Obama apologists in the mainstream media, they say, oh, it's not his fault. But we have news for the media. We knew that things were bad, but that's no excuse for making things worse. (Cheers, applause.) Four years ago, Barack Obama was an unproven leader. Well, today he's proven himself. He's proven that he's not up for the job.\nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan will be up to the job on day one. (Cheers, applause.) Like Paul Ryan, I'm from Wisconsin 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爓here Republicans have done pretty well in recent years. Well, here's why: because we govern like we campaign. We made promises, and we kept promises. That's what Americans want, leaders of their word.\nWell, President Obama, as we all know, is a man of many words, but he's not a man of his word. He broke his promise to cut the deficit in half, and he broke his promise to fix the economy. And adding insult to injury, he actually attacks success.\nThis president looks down on American free enterprise. As Speaker Boehner just said, the president said, if you've got a business, you didn't build that.\nWe --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\nREINCE PRIEBUS: Yeah, we do build it. Right? (Cheers, applause.) That makes me think 鈥斅爐hat makes me think that Barack Obama has a problem with the American dream.\nI grew up in a place called Kenosha, Wisconsin. My dad was a union electrician, and he retired from the Racine Unified School District.\nYou know, when we drove through the town, he didn't point to that big, beautiful house on the corner and my dad didn't say, hey, look at these lousy people over here. He did what every one of your parents did. He said, listen up, pal. If you work hard and you go to school, you're going to be in that house. And mom and dad, well, we pray that it's three times bigger.\nNo parent in America, Democrat or Republican, wants the kind of negative, glass-empty view of America that President Obama is trying to sell. We're the party that celebrates success. (Cheers, applause.) We're the party 鈥斅爓e're the party that believes in the American dream and wants all of our children to have a chance to succeed.\nSo, this convention is an invitation to all Americans to join us as we fight for a better future. This is our generation's rendezvous with destiny. This is our generation's time for choosing. If you believe that America can do better than the last four years, we stand with you. If you believe the next generation deserves a shot at the American dream, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan stand with you. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are so blessed to be here together. We're going to have a great week. I thank you all for being here, and God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers.)\nJOHN BOEHNER: Delegates, alternates, ladies and gentlemen, the convention will be in order. (Sounds gavel.)\nYou know, we begin tonight with a fundamental question: Can we do better? (Cheers.) The answer, in my view, is obvious: You bet we can!\nYou know, the American people are still asking the question: Where are the jobs? Now, President Obama only offers excuses instead of answers. His record is a shadow of his rhetoric. Yet he has the nerve to say that he's moving us forward, and the audacity to hope that we're going to believe him.\nAllow me to illustrate. You know, I'm what you'd call a regular guy with a big job. I've got 11 brothers and sisters, and my dad and my uncles owned a bar in Cincinnati. I worked there growing up, mopping floors, waiting tables, tending bar. So believe me when I say I learned how to deal with every character who walked in the door.\nSo let's say right now some guy walked into our bar full of guys looking for work, having a tough go of it, and the guy said, well, the private sector's doing fine. Well, you know what we'd do? That's right. We'd throw him out.\nThink about this. A guy walked into our bar full of people paying more for health care, paying more for gas, paying more for everything, and this guy would say: Well, we're better off than what we would have been.\nWell, you know what we'd do. We'd throw him out. (Cheers, applause.)\nNow, if a guy walked into our bar full of folks who couldn't tell 鈥斅燾ouldn't tell you the last time they got a raise or their house was above water and the guy said, well, we tried our economic plan and it worked, you know what we'd do. We'd throw him out.\nNow, let's say a guy walked into our bar, and before he could say anything, he overheard a regular telling his story. Turns out this guy ran a small business, got involved in it while he was in school. Then, out of nowhere, his business partner died. They had just one customer. So he fought like hell through sleepless nights and close calls, and 鈥斅�(audio break) 鈥斅爐hank God, paid their dues, proud of what they've managed to do.\nNow, if a guy walked into a bar and heard that story, and he said, well, if you've got a business, you didn't build that, well, you know what we'd do with him, don't you? We'd throw him out. (Cheers.) By the way, that small business guy is my story. That was our business, and we did build that. (Cheers, applause.) But, you know, it could have just as easily been the story of anyone who's built something from nothing, no guarantees, no government there to hold your hand, just a dream and the desire to do better.\nPresident Obama doesn't get this. He can't fix the economy because he doesn't know how it was built. So in 70 days when the American people walk into the voting booth, what should we do? We should throw him out, because we can do better. We can do a lot better.\nAnd it starts with throwing out the politician who doesn't get it and electing a new president who does. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, Mitt Romney comes from a family of builders. His father built houses, built businesses, built industry. George Romney was a can-do kind of guy, and he was fond of the old saying that when things are at their worst, that's just the place and the time that the tide will turn. Well, delegates, this is that time, and this is that place. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe're here to preserve this country the same way we built it: by exercising our God-given right to set a new course. So who better to turn this tide than the man who has dedicated his career to doing just that for states, for businesses, for the Olympic Games? President Romney 鈥斅燽oy, I like the sound of that. (Cheers, applause.) President Romney will keep his word, and he'll keep his courage too. He'll keep faith with the idea that government exists to serve the people and the people who built this economy.\nMitt's jobs plan will build a stronger middle class through energy independence, schools where our kids, not the teachers unions, come first, free trade, the path to a balanced budget and an end to the uncertainty and the tax hikes that threaten small businesses. It's a big job, so we're fortunate that Mitt has chosen his running mate as a leader who is second to none when it comes to rooting out and fixing Washington's worst habits.\nWhen I met Paul Ryan 22 years ago, he was a student at Miami of Ohio volunteering on my first campaign for Congress. (Cheers, applause.) Soon he'll be our party's nominee for vice president of the United States. Who says this isn't the greatest country on earth?\n(Cheers, applause.)\nYou know, they call this America's comeback team. Well, any good comeback needs some true believers. So if you believe that we can do better, if you want your children and our children to have a stronger, more prosperous America, then Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan need your help, because we cannot turn this tide 鈥斅爋nly, though, if all of us are all in all of the time, all the way until the 6th of November. It starts here with a convention that will lead to victory for our party and, more importantly, victory for our people and the great cause of freedom.\nGod bless you. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Boehner! Boehner! Boehner!",
    "STEVE KING: Good evening. In two short months our country faces a momentous decision. We will decide whether to continue our slide into debt and dependence, or whether to restore opportunity and self-determination.\nI believe at this time America's looking for leadership. Americans are searching for substance.\nWe're here tonight because Mitt Romney has chosen as his running mate the first real leader of his generation, a man who can help us believe in America again, and his name is Paul Ryan. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe're here tonight as Republicans, united and excited for a Romney-Ryan presidency.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!\nSTEVE KING: I remember talking with Paul when he was weighing his first congressional race, and even at the age of 27, he was a man with big ideas and the courage of his convictions.\nPaul's time in politics has really been a family affair.\nHis brother Tobin helped lead Paul's first campaign. His mother Betty and sister-in-law Oakley knocked on doors and handed out flyers. And now Paul is joined by his lovely wife, Janna, and his daughter Liza and his sons Charlie and Sam.\nYou'll find them in church at any given Sunday and after that watching a Packers or a Brewers game or swapping hunting and fishing stories with family. From his very first campaign, Paul asked voters directly, hire me, and has since always reminded his constituents, remember, I work for you. He never forgets who he works for. And no one has been more diligent and effective in working for the good of Wisconsin and America.\nPaul Ryan has the courage to tell the truth even when the truth is hard to hear. (Cheers, applause.) Paul Ryan has big, thoughtful ideas. Paul Ryan has the determination to tackle tough challenges, even those that others choose to ignore. Paul Ryan is the leader we need at this critical moment in our nation's history.\nNow, Mitt Romney believes that. Do we? (Cheers, applause.) (Chuckles.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it is my singular great honor and distinct privilege to nominate my good friend, my fellow citizen of Janesville, Wisconsin, a genuinely good man from the Midwest, Paul D. Ryan, to be vice president of the United States of America.\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nRON KAUFMAN: A friend of mine who founded Staples with Mitt once said to me, the incredible thing about Mitt Romney is that he makes everyone around him greater than they were. One of the folks who went on to help Mitt Romney at the Olympics in Salt Lake City said, every day you drove to work, you said to yourself that I owed it to Mitt to be better today than I was yesterday.\nIf ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than they were yesterday, that time is now. Today we come together as a party to nominate a president, a man who will energize and inspire this great country of ours. The time has come for a new day in America, one of more freedom, one filled with more opportunity and jobs, and one filled with a whole bunch less debt. That time has come. That man is 鈥斅�(inaudible) 鈥斅爐hat time. The moment is now. That man is Mitt Romney.

    "(Applause.)\nJOHN SUNUNU: Good evening.\nIn these critical times, America needs a leader. Our economy is stagnant. Our vitality has been sapped. Our confidence is down. We're saddled with a failed presidency, with an incumbent president who has not led.\nAmerica needs real change. And now we are here to affirm a leader that will produce that change. There are many reasons America needs Mitt Romney at the helm. We have 23 million Americans unemployed or underemployed because Barack Obama cannot figure out what makes free enterprise work. (Cheers, applause.)\nMitt Romney will get our private sector moving again and will respect the successes of our entrepreneurs who deserve credit because they really did build it. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn these difficult times, our nation still depends on others for our energy resources, even though we share the largest supplies of energy in the world, because we have an administration now that shuns those assets and keeps us dependent on fragile foreign supplies.\nMitt Romney will unshackle our assets and lead us to real energy independence. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe are also a nation that has seen erosion of our respect around the world because we now have a president who prefers to lead from behind. Mitt Romney will restore our strength, support our friends, face up to our foes and regain honest respect for an America willing to lead. (Applause.)\nMy wife, Nancy, and I have gotten to know Mitt and Ann Romney well. We've developed a deep and sincere appreciation for these two friends and their family. We like them, and we respect them.\nTonight we're all gathered here to put in motion the final phase of our campaign to help an 鈥斅燗merica know them better and to appreciate why our nation needs them as our president and our first lady.\nMitt Romney is a good man. Mitt Romney is a smart man. He is compassionate and generous. He's a great father and a supportive friend. He's been a very successful businessman and an extremely effective governor. Mitt Romney knows how to fix the unfixable and to help people perform to their highest potential. Mitt Romney is the right man at the right time and will be a great leader for our country. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "BARBARA COMSTOCK: Throughout his life, friends, family, businesses, charities, troubled entities and the commonwealth have turned to a leader, Mitt Romney when they needed wisdom, support or a turnaround. Each time, he answered the call and he led.\nMitt Romney, with humility, grace and diligence has succeeded at everything he's done: as a governor with a Cabinet that was 50 percent women, at turning around the scale-plagued Olympics, as a businessman, as a husband, a father, a grandfather and a trusted friend. He is a man uniquely prepared and committed to lead America at this critical point when we can do so much better with the right leadership.\nI am so pleased that this week, the American people are again meeting this man, this leader and seeing what so many of us who have been privileged to know and work with him over the years have always seen. This is a man to admire, respect, love and entrust the leadership of our country.\nI am so deeply honored and so proud to second the nomination of Mitt Romney for the office of president of the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nBARBARA COMSTOCK: Greetings from the Commonwealth of Virginia, where the American story began.\nWhat started with entrepreneurs arriving in Jamestown in 1607 and grew with the wisdom of Washington, Jefferson and Madison shaped a nation and the world. Lovers of freedom and liberty, members of all races and religions from across the globe now live and prosper in Virginia, which is one of the best places to live, work, start a business and raise a family.\nOver the past four years we in Virginia have kept the American dream alive by observing the president's policies and doing the opposite. Right? (Chuckles.)\nNow if re-elected, President Obama would double down on his job- destroying policies. He promises to raise our taxes and hurt working families and businesses.\nHe mocks our right-to-work laws. His budget failure threatens to slash 200,000 national security and high-tech jobs in Virginia. His war on success undermines individual initiative and innovation.\nObama isn't working. President Mitt Romney and Vice President Paul Ryan will. (Applause.) They have a common-sense plan to reward and unleash our entrepreneurs and innovators and put America back to work. They will be unapologetic in championing the American dream.\nNow, in 70 days, let's renew our founding fathers' victory for freedom. Let's guarantee that our children and their children continue this American story of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all.\nThank you so much, and Virginia, let's keep winning.

    "LISA STICKAN: (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. As chairman of the Young Republican National Federation, I hear from young people all over the country, especially back home in Ohio. (Cheers, applause.)\nAnd times are bad under Barack Obama and his leadership. The labor force participation is at its lowest level in 30 years, 23 million Americans are unemployed, underemployed or have stopped looking for work. And quite simply, the jobs just aren't there.\nHousehold incomes have fallen and debt has risen. We are paying more for health care and getting less choice. There is a war on young people, a war on paychecks and a war on our ability to succeed. We are working to build our own businesses, struggling to pave our own way, only to learn that, according to this president, we didn't build it.\nBut there is the hope for the change of a new day. Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get this country back on track, and the Young Republicans are excited. (Cheers, applause, chuckles.) We are ready for government to get out of the way so our job creators can actually create jobs.\nWe are ready for leadership that leads from the front. We are ready for change, we are ready to elect Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nRAE LYNNE CHORNENKY: Thank you. I bring you greetings from the National Federation of Republican Women, an organization of more than 75,000 Republican women across the nation. As in every recent election victory, in November, success will depend on our ability to energize and mobilize women voters. (Cheers, applause.)\nRecently, our National Federation of Republican Women conducted a survey of more than 8,500 Republican women and asked them what they want from their government. Number one, they want less interference and fewer regulations controlling businesses. Number two, they want the kind of strong fiscal conservative leadership that only Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can deliver.\nWe hear a lot from the media about the Republicans' so-called war against women. Well, which war? Which women? Is it the 850,000 women who have lost their jobs under President Obama? Or the women whose family household income has dropped by $4,300 since this president 鈥斅�(audio break). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women lost 92 percent of all the jobs lost under the Obama administration. If there is a war against women, it is President Obama who has waged it. (Cheers, applause.)\nJoin us in restoring sanity in our government by electing Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)",

I am pleased to be here representing my fellow Republican mayors.\nIn Oklahoma, we think we've made a very real and substantial contribution to this presidential ticket. Janna Ryan, the smart and charming wife of the next vice president of the United States, is from Oklahoma. (Cheers, applause.) She and Paul were married in Oklahoma City. And while it's becoming more and more unusual for our best and brightest to leave the state, in this case we're glad it's worked out the way it has.\nWe are enjoying a renaissance in Oklahoma City. It's a renaissance fueled by sound, fiscally conservative leadership, and also a belief that local investment in infrastructure is vital to economic development.\nTwenty years ago, we decided that we can do better, and we have. Today we have the nation's lowest unemployment rate among large U.S. metropolitan cities. (Cheers.) And while there is certainly a role in Washington in helping to address our cities' critical infrastructure needs, we in Oklahoma City have chosen to invest in ourselves. We have built quality-of-life amenities that have transformed our city into a dynamic home for smart young people and enterprising businesses.\nOklahoma City was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in the country, with the most startups per capita. And interestingly, we have not done this by creating large amounts of debt. We did something unique for many of our infrastructure packages: we paid cash. (Cheers.)\nToday we are building a community that is more walkable, more sustainable, more affordable and more business friendly, and we are building it with the kind of common-sense economic policies that we need in Washington 鈥斅爌olicies that Mitt Romney will deliver as the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "CHRIS FUSSNER: Thank you. I am honored to be here today with you.\nIn these few months leading up to the election, all eyes are on rallying Republicans here at home. But Republicans living and working abroad also play a critical role in electing and supporting candidates through voting and fundraising.\nAs global chair of Republicans Abroad, I live in Singapore and work with 50 chapters overseas. Our job is to encourage American citizens to register and vote Republican. (Cheers, applause.)\nWith over 4 million Americans living overseas, it is often a challenge to convince overseas voters that their vote matters. But consider the 2000 election: it was the overseas voters from right here in Florida that determined the outcome of that election. And Connie Mack often credits the success of his first election to Republicans Abroad.\nSo please, remind your friends and family living abroad that their civic duty does not end at the water's edge. Their vote matters, and every vote cast 鈥斅爐hose cast here or abroad. So, Republicans, let us come together to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nThank you and God bless. (Applause.)",

I get to push back against the bastions of liberalism: America's colleges and universities.\nEvery day I'm thankful to be employed. Yet, unfortunately, many of my peers are not as lucky. Half of my generation didn't get up and go to a job this morning. Many of them 鈥斅爄n fact, three in 10 鈥斅爃ave graduated this year and moved back in with their parents.

Instead, our generation is having a mark made on us.\nOur country is nearly $16 trillion in debt, a burden placed on our generation's back. We're tired of it, and we're tired of a president and his cronies in Congress being all too willing to kick the nation's fiscal crisis down to our road.\nGovernor Mitt Romney has a plan to get America back to work, to rein in our out-of-control spending, and to get our great country back on a sustainable path. That plan is just what we need.\nAt the end of the day, Barack Obama has failed young Americans. We're out of jobs, we're out of hope and we're out of change. (Cheers, applause.)

(Cheers, applause.)\nPETE SESSIONS: Good afternoon. I'm Pete Sessions, a congressman from Dallas, Texas, and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. I'm delighted to be here with our team, our delegates who every day help sell the fight in every community across this country as we stand up to make Barack Obama a one-term president. (Cheers, applause.)\nIn 2008 I declared that we would retire Nancy Pelosi, and the pundits laughed. I traveled the country recruiting community leaders who, like their neighbors, were concerned about the future of America under the Pelosi-Obama regime. Together, we did retire Nancy Pelosi, and we brought common sense to the House by placing the gavel firmly in Speaker Boehner's hands. (Cheers, applause.)\nHowever, the fight didn't stop there. The Republican message that won us the majority in 2010 of implementing free enterprise policies that create jobs and repealing \"Obamacare\" will continue to allow each of us to grow our House majority, to take back the Senate and to make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe have a diverse group of competitive candidates this cycle also, our lead salesmen that will boost the Romney-Ryan ticket. These candidates, many of whom you will hear from shortly, have the will to win.\nThey are on offense to defeat the big-government Democrats.\nThan you for all that you do to help in our fight to rebuild the American dream. Thank you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Running to represent the 9th Congressional District of California, please welcome Ricky Gill.\nRICKY GILL: Good afternoon. My name is Ricky Gill, and I am humbled to stand before you as a Republican nominee for Congress and a proud son of California's San Joaquin Valley. (Cheers, applause.)\nMy parents 鈥斅爉y parents immigrated to the valley from India and Africa with only their love for each other, a strong work ethic and the enduring desire to pursue their American dream. We all work hard in the valley, and we're proud to live there.\nBut today we face crippling unemployment and foreclosures, even the bankruptcy of Stockton, our largest city. Young people leave or drop out of school to help their families make ends meet. Our friends and neighbors are suffering.\nBut the valley is a cautionary tale of failed policies, not false ambitions. No one in this country dreams of dependency. No one hopes for mediocrity. We are ready again to seize the measure of our ambitions not because the government says we can but because we believe we can.\nWe need a new generation of leadership to chart the path, to fight for policies that create jobs rather than red tape and to help small businesses succeed rather than helping green energy companies fail.\nLike you, we valley folks are tough, independent and faithful, and we are ready to rebuild our American dream. Thank you, and God bless America. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: From Texas's 23rd district, please welcome Congressman Quico Canseco. (Cheers, applause.)\nQUICO CANSECO: Good afternoon. My name is Francisco Canseco, and I represent the 23rd district of Texas. (Cheers.)\nMitt Romney and I share a very simple belief: We owe our children a much better future. We owe them a future without high unemployment, without higher taxes and without a crushing burden of debt. Along the nearly 800 miles of U.S.-Mexico border that I serve, farmers, small businesses and families are striving to live the American dream. Whether you are a seventh-generation American or a first-generation immigrant coming to seek a better life, like my parents were, we all want the opportunity to succeed.\nUnfortunately, Barack Obama is burdening us with destructive debt, punishing taxes and rubbing 鈥斅爎obbing us of the opportunity to succeed. We can ensure our children have a brighter future if we follow this guidance: Un gobierno limitado y con menos impuestos significa mas oportunidad y mejores empleos para un futuro mas prospero para las siguientes generaciones.

(Cheers, applause.)\nANDY BARR: Beyond the rolling hills of the blue grass, within the depths of steep mountainsides, Kentuckians built a coal industry that powers America. (Cheers, applause.) But Barack Obama doesn't care.\nCoal provides Kentuckians with some of the lowest electricity costs in America, enabling companies like Toyota 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅爐o create over 7,000 jobs in Georgetown, Kentucky. But Barack Obama doesn't care.\nThis year alone 2,000 Kentucky miners lost their jobs because of overregulation and Obama's war on coal. For every mining job lost, three additional jobs are threatened, including those at Toyota. But President Obama doesn't care. (Boos.)\nRarely in history has a single industry been so ruthlessly attacked with so little regard for the people it hurts, people like Chris Woods (sp), a young coal miner who took me underground to show me his work.\nChris (sp) considers himself lucky. He still has a job driving an hour each way for a 10-hour shift. His paycheck supports his wife, two kids and both sets of parents.\nChris (sp) looked at me in the eyes, and I will never forget his words. Andy, he said, I don't know much about politics, and frankly, I don't care much about politics. But if you can save my job, I'm for you. (Cheers, applause.)\nChris (sp), I care about your job.

(Cheers, applause.)\nDAVID ROUZER: Hello, North Carolina! (Cheers, applause.) Hello, America! (Cheers, applause.)\nYou can feel it. Our country is at a crossroads. This election will determine whether we continue on the path of more spending, more debt and economic disaster, or whether we choose real solutions and return to the basic principles of free enterprise and limited government.\nNow, at this critical hour in our nation's history, we can't afford to re-elect Barack Obama, a man who believes that America is the problem. We can't afford to re-elect a man who doesn't understand that it was the hard work and achievement of the American people that made this country great. We can't afford to re-elect someone who believes that our dismal economy is doing just fine.\nAnd in North Carolina's 7th Congressional District, we can't afford to re-elect Mike McIntyre, a man who voted four times to make Nancy Pelosi the speaker and then voted with her more than 90 percent of the time 鈥斅燼gain, more than 90 percent of the time 鈥斅爓hile she controlled the House. We can't afford to re-elect a man like Mike McIntyre, who said about Obama's failed stimulus: In our part of the country, it has worked.\nLadies and gentlemen, let's send Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and their lieutenant Mike McIntyre home and restore America to greatness.

In North Carolina, we tell the truth. The truth is, you can't support open-ended bailouts and giveaways if you want to create jobs. You can't support \"Obamacare\" and say you want to save Medicare. And you can't support Barack Obama if you want to stop the spending, stop the waste, stop the assault on our values. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Go Hudson!\nnRICHARD HUDSON: This election is about real people, people who are suffering under the policies of President Barack Obama and his friends, like Congressman Larry Kissell. It's about the woman in Thomasville, North Carolina, who told me she has to support two men at home, her husband, who was laid off recently, and her son, who just graduated from college and can't find a job. And it's about the homebuilder in Monroe, North Carolina, who will take any kind of work just to avoid having to lay off any more of his employees. And by the way, Mr. President, he did build that job. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe people of North Carolina are suffering under President Obama, and it's not just time for a change, it's time for the great American comeback. (Cheers, applause.) And I give you my word that I'll fight every single day for what's right, because it's not about politics, it's about people. It's about our future. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are right for America.

We have a president who wants his party to make us all dependent on government. We need leaders who believe in the prosperity that the free market brings.\nWe have a president who tramples on our First Amendment rights to religious liberty by requiring all taxpayers to fund abortions. We need public servants who respect life and our religious freedom. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe have a president who is all too willing to lead from behind. We need a White House that will unflinchingly support our strongest ally, Israel. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe need a president who believes in America. (Cheers, applause.) We have a nation that is too precious to give up on. We have a history that is too glorious to be forgotten. We have a constitution that is too noble to be rewritten, and we still have a God who reigns over the affairs of nations. (Cheers, applause.) And we have a people who once again are ready to stand up as we the people and choose for themselves the direction of their beloved country.\nI'm Mark Meadows. I'm running for Congress.

But I worked hard and was able to become a doctor and raise my family in northern Michigan. That was my American dream.\nAlong the way, it never occurred to me to get into politics, let alone run for Congress. But I did two years ago because, like many of you, I was disgusted by what was going on in Washington. They're spending away our children's and grandchildren's futures. Today the American dream is being threatened.\nI know our nation is facing enormous challenges. Unemployment is far too high. We have nearly $16 trillion in debt. It's hard for Michigan families to make ends meet. But I believe we can fix these problems by staying true to what has always made this country great 鈥斅爄ndividual liberty, free enterprise and limited government.

We have more doubt, families don't know how much \"Obamacare\" will cost them, and businesses don't know what new regulations will burden them and we have more despair.\nFor 42 months, unemployment has been above 8 percent. We keep waiting for it to improve 鈥斅燼nd waiting, and waiting, and waiting. We don't have to wait anymore. We can do better. (Cheers, applause.)

(Applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Our House candidate for Indiana's 2nd District, please welcome Jackie Walorski. (Cheers, applause.)\nJACKIE WALORSKI: Good afternoon. (Cheers.) I am proud to represent the great state of Indiana, which we affectionately refer as the Hoosier State. (Cheers.)\nHoosiers cherish values, like common sense, hard work and problem solving. And there's a lot that Washington can learn from the Hoosier State. When Indiana faced a massive budget shortfall, we didn't play partisan games. We came together, we rolled up our sleeves, and we turned a billion-dollar deficit into a surplus. We understood that when you have a deficit, spending more money is not the solution. In the face of record unemployment, we understood that more government spending will not create jobs. That's why we passed common-sense reforms that made it easier to do business and create jobs in our great state. I can tell you, as a result, Indiana has been rated as the best Midwest state to do business in, and we are among the nation's leaders in job growth. (Cheers.)\nIn the Hoosier State, we proved a very simple lesson: Working together is the best way to solve our problems. And Washington can do the same. By cutting spending, reducing the red tape, we can unleash our small businesses to create jobs. And with Hoosier common sense, we can balance the budget, we can get our nation's economy working again. American workers and American entrepreneurs are the best in the world. (Cheers.)\nI'm ready to carry their torch to Washington and to prove there will never be a mountain too high for us to climb. (Cheers, applause.) The American spirit will always persevere. Fellow Hoosiers, it's your time to take back this country. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless this great nation of America.

For the past 28 years, I've built businesses and created hundreds of jobs. My wife, Cindy, and I have been married for 25 years, and we're the parents of four great kids.\nNow out-of-control spending, crushing debt, job-destroying regulations 鈥斅爐hey threaten our children's future. We have more government than ever before. Our economy is stagnant. Families are struggling. And the America we love is threatened.\nWashington does not create jobs. The American people do.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes! (Cheers.)\nSTEVE DAINES: I'm grateful that six generations of my family have called Montana home. My great-great-grandmother left Norway, and she came to Montana in search of a better future. As a widow with seven children, she homesteaded on the plains of northern Montana.\nOn her tombstone are three simple words: \"Saved by Grace.\"\nThe words \"Saved by government\" would never have crossed her mind. She put her faith in God, not government. (Cheers.)\nIn 70 days, our nation faces a pivotal election, and our choice is absolutely clear. We can do better and we will do better when we elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nThank you so much, and God bless. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: From the 3rd District of Utah, please welcome Congressman Jason Chaffetz. (Cheers, applause.)\nJASON CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thank you.\nAmerica's in trouble. If you spend a million dollars a day every day, it would take you almost 3,000 years to get to $1 trillion. We are now nearly $16 trillion in debt. Each day we pay more than $600 million a day in interest on that debt. And we deficit-spend $3 billion per day.\nExcessive regulations choke businesses. Our tax code punishes success, discourages entrepreneurs and stifles growth. President Obama's solution? More government, more taxes.\nThis is not the American dream. Our nation is not just one good tax increase from prosperity. American success hasn't come from czars, Cash for Clunkers, endless bailouts, a limitless government credit card or more taxes for more government. The American dream was built on the sweat and blood of Americans that took pride in personal ownership, in themselves and their country. When times were tough, generations before quietly rolled up their sleeves and built a stronger, more prosperous nation. The government didn't build it; they built it.\nAmerica was built with hard work, dedication to principles and a belief that success was predicated on liberty and ownership. Restoring the American dream will require fiscal discipline, limited government, accountability and a strong national defense.\nWe need to make 鈥斅爓e need to make tough choices. We need leadership. We need to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan because we need to believe in America again.\nThank you, and may God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Please give a very hearty welcome to Congressman Tim Scott of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. (Cheers, applause.)\nTIM SCOTT: Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThe past four years of hope and change have led me to one simple conclusion: Our only hope is to change the current resident of the White House. (Cheers, applause.) Amen. And I'm so proud to support the next president of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nYou see, as a poor kid growing up in a single-parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, I felt like I didn't have much going for me. But I did have a couple of things: A mom who believed in tough love, and that love comes at the end of a switch 鈥斅燼nd my momma loved me a lot. 鈥斅�(laughter) 鈥斅燼nd a small-business owner who was my mentor and taught me that I could think my way out of poverty. He taught me that having a job is a good thing, but creating jobs was even better.\nMitt Romney embodies the same vision for America that my mentor had for me. He believes that the path forward is more important than the place where we began.\nAnd let me close by giving President Obama a heartfelt message from the good people of South Carolina: \"Hit the road, Jack, and you don't you come back no more, no more, no more!\" (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you! (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Representing the 7th District of the great state of Wisconsin, please welcome the former world champion lumberjack, athlete, congressman: Sean Duffy.\nSEAN DUFFY: Hey, hey! (Cheers, applause.) Hello, Tampa! Hello, Wisconsin! (Cheers, applause.)\nI am a proud member of the party of Reagan, Romney and Ryan. (Cheers, applause.)\nAs a father of six, my biggest worry is that our children are losing their shot at the American dream. Today record unemployment is dashing the dreams of our college graduates. Instead of moving onto their dream jobs, they're moving into their parents' basement. The debt we're passing off to our kids is a shameful legacy. And Obama's big government policies have made this the worst recovery since the Great Depression. This is not a liberal problem. This is not a conservative problem. This economy is America's problem. (Cheers, applause.)\nObama's quest to spread the wealth has only managed to spread the misery. We have a better idea. Let's spread the economic growth. (Cheers, applause.) And we will spread it from the breweries of Wisconsin to the barrios of California. (Cheers, applause.)\nIf you voted for Obama and you have buyer's remorse, let me tell you: Mitt Romney is the hope, and Paul Ryan is the change. (Cheers, applause.) A vote for Romney-Ryan is a vote for a dream ticket, a dream ticket that will end the Obama economic nightmare. (Cheers, applause.) It is a vote for fiscal sanity and responsibility in Washington, and it is a vote to put America back to work.\nLet's get it done. God bless. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Running for Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, please welcome Keith Rothfus. (Cheers, applause.)\nKEITH ROTHFUS: Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon, delegates. (Cheers, applause.) Hello, Pennsylvania!\nWe heard and we will continue to hear a great deal about health care and Medicare in this election. And that's a good thing. As a cancer survivor, no issue is more personal to me than health care and the strength of our doctor-patient relationships.\nHaving developed and survived a very rare form of cancer that kills 75 percent of its victims within five years, I know all too well the importance of a health care system that empowers the doctor- patient relationship and respects the decisions of the family.\nThere is no greater threat to the health care of our nation and the health care of our seniors than \"Obamacare.\" (Scattered applause.) And no matter what path we take to save Medicare, the very first step is to repeal \"Obamacare.\" (Cheers, applause.)\nMy district, Pennsylvania-12, has one of the largest concentrations of Medicare populations in the entire country. My opponent, Congressman Critz, voted over 20 times to support \"Obamacare,\" including voting against the repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which empowers not doctors and patients, but bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\nThere is only one ticket that will defend patients, defend doctors and defend families in this health care battle. There is only one ticket that will save Medicare from bankruptcy, will preserve Medicare for today's seniors and will strengthen Medicare for the future. To repeal, to replace, to restore, vote Romney, Ryan and, in western Pennsylvania, Rothfus.\nThank you, and may God bless America.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Please give a very warm welcome to Congressman Tim Griffin, representing the 2nd District of Arkansas. (Cheers, applause.)\nTIM GRIFFIN: Thank you. Thank you. I am proud to represent Arkansas's 2nd Congressional District.\nI'm fighting to change Washington at its core because I know we can do better. Record unemployment, record debt and $716 billion raided from Medicare to pay for \"Obamacare\" 鈥斅爓e can do better.\nIn Little Rock, we have a company with over 500 miles of pipe ready for the Keystone pipeline. But that pipe is sitting in a stack because President Obama says, you can't build that. We can do better. (Cheers, applause.)\nWe can't afford to rehire someone with a bankrupt vision and a failed plan. This moment in history is too big. The security of our children and grandchildren is too important.\nYou know, like a man who's lost but won't ask for directions, President Obama has no earthly idea how to solve this country's problems. Yet he beams with confidence in his uncertainty. And who is his navigator? Joe Biden. (Boos.) Folks, we know we can do better.\nWhen I look at my daughter Mary Katherine (sp) and my son Baby John (sp), I have no choice but to be optimistic about the future of our great country. But I don't want us to waste this opportunity. We have an opportunity to replace small, rudderless confusion with bold, purposeful leadership. Let's do better. (Cheers.) Let's elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and send Barack Obama and Joe Biden on a permanent vacation. (Cheers, applause.)\nGod bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: And now we will hear from our candidates for the United States Senate.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our Senate candidate for the great state of Nebraska, Deb Fischer. (Cheers, applause.)\nDEB FISCHER: Hello. (Cheers, applause.) Hello. Thank you.\nI'm not your usual politician. I'm a wife. I'm the mother of three grown sons. I'm a rancher and a small-business owner and a citizen legislator.\nBecoming U.S. Senator was never an ambition of mine. But over the last four years I'd become very dismayed with the record spending, the record debt and the record unemployment.\nThe Obama administration has been out of touch with the American people, and they've driven our country towards the edge of a fiscal cliff. We're on track to become the first generation that passes on fewer opportunities to the next. And that is unacceptable. But it doesn't have to be this way.\nI'm running for the U.S. Senate because I know that we can do better. I've been a senator in Nebraska legislature these past eight years. And in Nebraska, we have an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. How did we get there? Well, hey, we cut spending. We balance our budget every year. And we passed the largest tax relief package in the history of our state.\nAnd most importantly, we got government out of the way, and we let the private sector do what it does best: grow our economy and create jobs. We've done it in Nebraska, and I know that we can do the same thing in Washington because we only have two options left. We can either continue the same policies of the past, or we can begin to make the tough decisions and lead our country responsibly.\nWe have a tremendous opportunity to set our country in a new, more prosperous direction, and it begins in November.\nThank you. Thank you very much, and God bless. (Cheers, applause.)\nANNOUNCER: Running to represent the great state of North Dakota in the U.S. Senate, please welcome Congressman Rick Berg. (Cheers, applause.)\nRICHARD BERG: Thank you, North Dakota! (Cheers, applause.) Thank you, Mr. Chairman and delegates. It's a privilege to share with you North Dakota's success story and to voice my support for our next president, Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama has put America on the wrong track, but my home state, North Dakota, shows a different way forward. We have less than 3 percent unemployment, rising salaries and a budget surplus. (Cheers, applause.) Mr. President, if you're still looking for an example where the private sector is actually doing fine, you can look to North Dakota. (Cheers, applause.)\nThat's because 鈥斅爐hat's because we don't burden our job creators with red tape. We understand, just like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, that small businesses are the engines of our economy. So we get government out of their way and let entrepreneurs build their businesses. We trust the individual, not big government, to make decisions about their money, families and opportunities. This is the North Dakota way, and it works.\nMitt Romney shares an understanding 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燤itt Romney shares an understanding of the solutions North Dakota has developed, and is prepared to lead where President Obama has left broken promises. With Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the White House and a Republican majority in the Senate, our North Dakota way can be the American way. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you, and God bless. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "BOB BUCKHORN: (Applause.) To Chairman Priebus and to my fellow Americans who have traveled from every corner of this great country to be here in Tampa today, thank you for the honor of hosting the 2012 Republican National Convention. Your faith and trust in us is much appreciated.\nNow let me tell you just a little bit about my city. We were built by people who worked hard and dreamed big. Immigrant families who came here from Germany, Spain, Italy and Cuba. They were cigar rollers, port workers, cattle rustlers. They were the economic engine that powered Tampa Bay. Today we are a city that represents all that is good about America.\nWe are leading Florida out of the recession. Unemployment is declining here faster than anywhere else. We are one of the fastest cities 鈥斅爁astest growing cities in the country. We have been called one of the best cities in America to do business.\nWe are attracting some of the best and brightest young people who want to be a part of our technology industry. We are curing diseases on the cutting edge of science and health care. And Tampa remains proud to be home of MacDill Air Force Base, the headquarters of United States Central Command and United States Special Operation Command. (Applause.)\nI can tell you with certainty that we are open for business and we are ready to embrace all that the future holds. As mayor, I stand here today representing an extraordinary group of law enforcement personnel, fire and police and thousands 鈥斅爐housands of local volunteers who have worked hard to make this a good convention for you. Each of them proud Americans excited to be part of the democratic process and eager to tell Tampa's story to the world. I trust you will fall in love with our city just as I do every day.\nHave a great week in Tampa. God bless and God bless America. (Applause.)",
    "(Music: \"We Are Family.\")\n(Cheers, applause.)\nSHARON DAY: Absolutely. Thank you, Mr.Chairman.\nWelcome, everyone, to my home state of Florida, and we are so honored to host you. And I am honored to serve as your Republican National Committee co-chair. (Cheers, applause.)\nEvery election, we heard that this is the most important election of our lifetime. This election is more than that. This election is the most important election in our nation's lifetime 鈥斅�(cheers, applause) 鈥斅燼bsolutely.\nIn 1775 our Founding Fathers rose up to establish our liberty. Today we need to defeat a president whose actions threaten our liberty. In this way, we are in a similar position as our Founding Fathers. Just as they were called upon, we are being called upon. What they started, what they believed in, we must now defend. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe danger for America is already here. It's in the form of the Democrat leaders in Washington. We have a Democrat Senate leader who refuses to meet his moral obligation to pass a budget for our government. (Applause.) We have a Democrat House leader that wouldn't allow a major piece of legislation, \"Obamacare,\" to be read before it was passed. She stated, and I quote, we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in it. (Boos.)\nWe have a president that has bypassed the Senate confirmation process in order to appoint unaccountable czars to make and enforce policies on America's citizens, a president that by his executive action has changed immigration laws, imposed unconstitutional burdens on our states and issued overreaching regulations.\nWe know the problem, America. Their names are Obama, Biden, Pelosi and Holder. What they have done and will continue to do should Obama be re-elected runs contrary to the values we believe in and the principles we stand for. It is our duty as citizen activists of this great Republican Party to fight to restore the values of our founding fathers.\nMy fellow members, this fight is not just about an election, and it's not about our party. Our fight is about our country, and we cannot lose this battle. (Applause.) Our founding fathers made huge personal sacrifices for what they believed in. The time is now for us to do the same.\nI am a proud grass-roots activist, one of many in my state and countless others from across this great country. Today, we need as many grass-roots activists from all walks of life and throughout this great nation to stand with us. The sacrifices we meet and the sacrifices we will make are nothing compared to the sacrifices our children and our grandchildren will face if we don't take back this country on November 6th by electing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\n(Cheers, applause.)\nWe must take this election house by house, precinct by precinct, city by city and state by state to bring our proud conservative message of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to every voter in America. (Cheers, applause.) When we leave Florida in just a few days, let's commit ourself (sic) to give all that we can to help the Romney-Ryan ticket. Together, let's make history. Together, let's defeat Barack Obama. And together, let's save our country for the next generation. (Cheers, applause.)\nThank you. God bless each of you. God bless our proud military and their families. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Godspeed. (Cheers, applause.)",
    "(Cheers, applause.)\nMIA LOVE: I am thrilled to add Utah's voice in support for Mitt Romney. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love Mia!\nMIA LOVE: Let me tell you about the America I know.\nMy parents immigrated to this country with $10 in their pockets and a hope that the America they heard about really did exist. When tough times came, they didn't look to Washington; they looked within. So the America I grew up knowing was centered in self-reliance and filled with the possibilities of living the American Dream. (Cheers, applause.)\nThe America I know is grounded in the determination found in patriots and pioneers, in small businesses with big ideas. It's found in the farmers who work in the beauty of our landscape and our heroic military.\nIt's found in the Olympic athletes and every child who looks at the seemingly impossible and says, I can do that. That's the America I know. (Cheers, applause.)\nPresident Obama's version of America is a divided one, often pitting us against each other based on income level, gender and social status. His policies have failed us. We're not better off than we were four years ago, and no rhetoric, bumper sticker or Hollywood campaign ad can change that. (Cheers, applause.)\nMr. President, I'm here to tell you the American people are awake, and we're not buying what you're selling in 2012. (Cheers, applause.) The American dream isn't just my story. It isn't just your story. It's our story.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right.\nMIA LOVE: It's a story of human struggle, standing up and striving for more. Our story has been told for over 200 years, with small steps and giant leaps, from a woman on a bus to a man with a dream, from the bravery of the greatest generation to the innovators and entrepreneurs of today, this is our story. This is our America. This is the America we know, because we built it. (Cheers, applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\nMIA LOVE: (Laughs.) Thank you. Yes, we did.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! (Cheers.)\nMIA LOVE: With 鈥斅爐hank you. With Paul Ryan 鈥斅爓ith Mitt Romney as president and Paul Ryan as vice president, we can restore and revive that America 鈥斅爐hat American story we know and love. The world will know it, our children will tell it, and our grandchildren will possess it for years to come.\nGod bless America! (Cheers.) This is our time! We are truly the best and last hope on earth! (Cheers.) Thank you! (Cheers, applause.)"
