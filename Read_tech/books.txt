This list of topics may evolve over the course of your interviews, but this will help you make sure that you get enough detail from each interview so that you are able to recognize the significant behavior patterns.

 Goals— What makes a good day? A bad day?

 Opportunity— What activities currently waste your time?

 Priorities— What is most important to you?

 Information— What helps you make decisions?

Another useful type of question is the system-oriented question:

 Function— What are the most common things you do with the product?

 Frequency— What parts of the product do you use most?

 Preference— What are your favorite aspects of the product? What drives  you crazy?

 Failure— How do you work around problems?

 Expertise—What shortcuts do you employ?

For business products,workflow-oriented questions can be helpful:

 Process— What did you do when you first came in today? And after that?

 Occurrence and recurrence— How often do you do this? What things do you

do weekly or monthly, but not every day?

 Exception— What constitutes a typical day? What would be an unusual event?

To better understand user motivations, you can employ attitude-oriented questions:

 Aspiration— What do you see yourself doing five years from now?

 Avoidance— What would you prefer not to do? What do you procrastinate on?

 Motivation— What do you enjoy most about your job (or lifestyle)? What do you always tackle first?
